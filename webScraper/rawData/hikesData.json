      "Tunnel Creek Trail has two trailheads.The south side trailhead is on the Dosewallips Road, but its notoriously steep grade to 5050 Pass means it is seldom used. Try it and you’ll find out why.",
      "Bring the kids for this one so they can join everyone else's kids in trooping up to see grand views at a lovely alpine lake, with none of those raspy-looking backpacker types fouling the air along the trail. Tolmie Peak is a day-hiker's special. It's about the right distance, offers the right touch of outdoor magic at its destination, and has been ruled off-limits to overnighters.",
      "Explore one of the quieter Olympic Peninsula river valleys. Quiet, that is, if you don't count the Duckabush River's constant belching, crashing, and churning as it tumbles over giant boulders and squeezes through narrow rocky clefts.",
      "Hike railroad grades dating from the logging era. Cross many small creeks, some of them seasonal. Pass tall trees draped with moss. Enjoy ferns and, in season, forest wildflowers and a few wild berries. Reach a fine viewpoint that's also a favorite launching spot for paragliders.",
      "Diamond Head, set on the eastern flank of the Cascades, offers a great chance to tromp through the deep snows under a clear blue sky and sparkling sunshine.",
      "With a starting elevation of 4,300, this tour is your best guarantee of good snow, even in a lean year.",
      "Short, easy trail to the Stillaguamish River and the site of the railroad town of Robe and great views of the Stilliguamish River as it races by. The trail switchbacks through a forest of alder down to a forest of big leaf maple draped with lush mosses, liverwort and licorice fern. The forest floor is thick with fern and colorful salmonberry. Watch the kids! The Stilliguamish runs swift and deep here, especially during periods of high water flow. It is not recommended to continue on to the old railroad tunnels due to trail washout, slope slump and rockfall.",
      "Banner Forest Heritage Park is one square mile of undeveloped forest and wetland on the Kitsap Peninsula with an extensive trail network. An easy grade and well maintained trails invite all ages and abilities to enjoy this prime section of land.",
      "Explore one of the many trails in Capitol State Forest as an out-and-back, or combined with another trail in the area.",
      "The Maui Loop is more of an adventure than a hike. You get to go up, over and around mogul-like mounds peppered with volcanic rock, explore the upper rim of Coyote Wall, and descend a grassy slope with uninterrupted views of the Colombia River Gorge. In the spring there is a steady progression of wildflowers, making this an especially good early-season hike.",
      "Take a short hike up a forested butte near Rattlesnake Lake, just 1.75 miles each way with 900 feet of elevation gain. Reach a summit with views toward the north, from Mount Si to Mailbox Peak, and several other peaks in between. Some hikers judge Cedar Butte to be a better viewpoint than the much-visited West Tiger #3 summit, and it requires less effort and has smaller crowds, so when you are ready for a change of scene check it out.",
      "Klahhane Ridge towers over the Hurricane Ridge Road, providing outstanding views of Mount Angeles and the long sweep of Hurricane Ridge. The trail climbs steeply, but once the work is done, snowshoers can trek along the long ridge stretched between Mount Angeles and Rocky Peak.",
      "This forested park, a wilderness with glimpses of Issaquah below, has miles of winding trails alongside bubbling creeks and narrow ravines. There are several trail loop options on this 2,024-foot-high mountain. With multi-use trails and a natural area, hikers have plenty to explore in this quiet sanctuary outside of Issaquah.",
      "Disregarding the apocryphal stories about their name, the Damfino Lakes are noteworthy only to distinguish this route from two other routes. The lakes pale in comparison to these magnificent destinations: Excelsior Pass, the High Divide, and Excelsior Peak.",
      "If you want to see the headwaters of the mighty Snoqualmie River, head for the source. Source Lake, that is. It's a modest pond, but the setting is remarkable. Craggy peaks ring this pool, found along the way to one of the state's most popular alpine lake -- Snow Lake.",
      "This is a wonderful wild park right here in the backyard of those who live in the Everett area. Covering 1,463 acres of forest, ponds and meadows, the area is named for homesteader Mitchell Lord who farmed the area in the late 1880s. Hikers can roam all day on the network of trails leading through the forest, down to the Snohomish River and up to views of the Cascades and Snohomish valley. Explore, and keep an eye out for the wildlife that live in these woods.",
      "The Upper Dungeness River trail is an easy stroll along a roaring river and among towering trees. It’s great for all ages (as long as the trail is snow- and ice-free), and the shelter at Camp Handy is a welcome and dry lunch destination on rainy days.",
      "When planning a trip along this route, be aware that when snow is unstable, avalanche dangers are scary. But when avalanche danger is listed as moderate or lower, the trail to Source Lake makes a wonderful outing for snowshoers.",
      "A relatively short and easy hike within a stone’s throw of Seattle, Snow Lake delivers splendorous alpine scenery – crystal clear waters, towering peaks – at a mere pittance of sweat and toil. Just don’t expect to have the trail to yourself – Snow Lake is Washington's most heavily-used trail in a wilderness area!",
      "This winter-only summit route is a straight shot from Bald Knob Campground to the summit of Mount Spokane.",
      "",
      "Skip the crowds of skiers and snowshoers at Hurricane Ridge and try a challenging hike on Obstruction Point Road.",
      "Make a steep ascent through flowerfilled slopes to views of high mountain peaks and pillow lavas that originated on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Whether you’re an expert or a first-timer, Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park is one of the most spectacular places to snowshoe in Washington state—and on clear days you’ll be treated to bird’s-eye views of Mount Olympus in all her winter splendor.",
      "PEACEFUL is the best way to describe the Stewart Glen portion of the Burnt Bridge Creek Greenway. This hike begins at backwaters on the west end of Stewart Glen and follows the Burnt Bridge Creek upstream though thick woods, grassy bottom lands, and a meadow. You will be immediately immersed in the serenity of nature, making this the perfect break from city life.",
      "Traverse across beautiful Chuckanut Mountain in Larrabee State Park. Enjoy views of Puget Sound, as well as Mount Baker along this high trail.",
      "A lake located above the extremely popular Snow Lake; Upper Wildcat offers backpacking opportunities for the route-finding enthusiasts in the summer months.",
      "This is a fine hike on a well maintained, albeit busy trail through a cool forest with views of the Cedar River watershed, Mount Si, Mount Washington, Rattlesnake Lake and Chester Morse Lake.",
      "This narrow forest trail climbs gently alongside a gurgling ice-rimmed creek and leads to a picturesque alpine lake.",
      "This easy day hike is a great destination for families staying in the Stehekin Valley. Huckleberries line the slopes in the fall, and the 200-foot deep gorge you hike along provides thrills at any time of year. Plus, it's a relatively short hike in a valley of miles-long trails."

      "The astounding views from the summit of the Granite Mountain trail come at a price. A nearly-1000-feet-of-elevation-gain-per-mile price. But views of pointed Kaleetan Peak, deep blue Crystal Lake, the climber-dotted Tooth, and Mount Rainier dominating the skyline to the south make it all worth it.",
      "Regardless of the air temperature, be prepared to sweat. But as strenuous as the well-trod summer path maybe, it's nothing compared to the snow route up the big mountain.",
      "Approachable throughout the year, the Mount Walker trail’s average 20% grade makes it a go-to route for hikers and trail runners looking for a short, brisk tromp. (While it is also a designated stock trail, riders and pack animals rarely make an appearance.) Spring, summer, and fall the 2-mile trail is both ascended and descended by those on foot. In the winter, when the Mount Walker road is gated closed to vehicles, many will pursue the then 2.25-mile jaunt up to the north viewpoint, saunter over to the south viewpoint and then descend on the more gentle grade of the road.",
      "Mount Ellinor is the southern-most prominence on the eastern front of the Olympics. This makes its peak easy to point out to your friends when you say, ”I was up there.” Mount Ellinor also gives you two trailheads to choose from. The lower trailhead at 2,600 feet welcomes you to the ascent with an easy grade at the outset. The route from the upper trailhead at 3,500 feet starts out with a nearly immediate upward jolt. The trails merge well before the summit and continue upward at a character-building grade.",
      "In the shadows of Mount Ellinor, enjoy this circuitous route around the Big Creek drainage. There are plenty of pretty resting and contemplation spots along the way. Plenty of cascades too, along Big Creek and the smaller creeks feeding into it.",
      "The hike to Lena Lake is doable for nearly every type of hiker, and the traffic on the trail is evidence of it. A wide path switchbacks gently at first and then just a little more steeply uphill through old- and second-growth forest to a large lake ringed by silent sentinels--huge old-growth fir trees that keep watch over day hikers and campers who elect to stay overnight at this wilderness refuge.",
      "This short loop out of Longmire makes for a great, quick way to get some elevation gain, some forest views, and a fantastic vista of Mount Rainier, all in less than five miles!",
      "The Boulder River trail is a nice hike that can be done any time of year. Come in winter while the rain is dripping off the mossy trees, photograph the waterfalls filled with spring snowmelt. Take the kids out for a little picnic in the summer, or leaf collecting in the fall. Come anytime midweek for quiet contemplation.",
      "View one of the best examples of a recessional-cataract canyon. Potholes Coulee caught the attention of J Harlen Bretz in the early 20th century, which led to his “outrageous hypothesis” of Ice Age flooding.",
      "Hike through a diverse century-old second-growth forest with a dense canopy to the undeveloped shoreline of Lake Washington. This historic 316-acre state park, nestled in the midst of the Seattle metropolitan area, has playground facilities for children, picnic areas, trails for mountain bikers, and fields for sports teams as well.",
      "Big trees and wetlands define this new 793-acre wildlife area near Woodinville. This is the headwaters of the Bear Creek watershed, a highly productive salmon stream within the Sammamish River Valley.",
      "There are many names for this short little hike. Mount Pete, Mount Peak, Pinnacle Peak Park, Cal Magnusson Trail.",
      "WTA has done some work in the local Cedar Downs Park, cleaning up after storms and brushing its trails. Cedar Downs is between Covington and Maple Valley and consists of 85 acres of mature forest.",
      "A steep, yet surprisingly comfortable climb to views of Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Glacier Peak, and the Olympics.",
      "This short, easy ridge walk climbs to a small summit with huge Cascade views and a chance to see mountain goats.",
      "The middle section of the Burnt Bridge Creek trail extends from Devine Road to Leverage Park. In this section of the trail, the character becomes more urban and passes close to houses and soccer fields. Nonetheless, the trail passes through some open grassy areas where you may spot a raptor looking for lunch.",
      "The eastern section of the Burnt Bridge Creek Trail follows the creek from Meadowbrook Marsh to Devine Road. This section of the trail features meadows and wetlands which host a variety of wildlife, including beavers, deer, and assorted birds. The creek flows through willows, cottonwoods, and red osier dogwood. The understory includes wild roses, spirea, and thimbleberry.",
      "Lacamas Park is a surprising swatch of forest between Camas and Washougal where you can easily take time out to relax and enjoy nature. The park has over six miles of trails, with both wide-hard surfaced paths and more primitive dirt tracks. This loop hike combines both types to give you the optimum experience while exploring a lake, creek, and two waterfalls. There is also an optional side trip to visit the Lily Fields, which are infused with purple camas blossoms from mid-April to mid-May. Although there are some heart-thumping uphill sections, the hike is generally easy and appropriate for reasonably fit people of all ages.",
      "The western section of the Burnt Bridge Creek Trail follows the creek from Leverage Park to Fruit Valley Road. Stewart Glen is the highlight of this section of the trail. The first part of the trail navigates from Leverage Park to the east end of Stewart Glen. The second part passes through a meadow, grassy bottom lands, and thick woods leading to the lake-like backwaters of Burnt Bridge Creek where you may see ducks bobbing or hear frogs croaking. If you would like a nature experience without the urban hassle, try the Stewart Glen Section of the Burnt Bridge Creek Trail instead of starting at Leverage Park.",
      "A challenging summit with a big payoff: a 360-degree panorama of more than 10 Cascades peaks.",
      "This excellent early-season romp heads up a lush river canyon boasting three gorgeous waterfalls with riverside campsites for an overnight, or a longer, more challenging loop.",
      "Located just off the pavement, this short and easy hike offers good views of the namesake falls, along with glimpses of Hall Mountain in the distance. Come in spring for the highest water volume, seek shade and mist in summer, and return in fall for the best foliage color.",
      "Fort Flagler State Park is one of five impressive military installations that were established in close proximity to protect Puget Sound from invaders during times of war.",
      "Hiking through a wide, level valley in the shadow of looming Kendall Peak to the north and Rampart Ridge to the east would be an ideal outing, if only so many people didn't know about it. Fortunately, a few miles up the trail, the crowds thin--or at least spread out--and snowshoers can get on with the business of learning to travel in a beautiful wilderness valley.",
      "A paved interpretive trail on the Mountain Loop Highway near Verlot. Perfect for exploring children, curious adults, an extra add-on after a longer hike, or a leg stretch during a driving tour of the area.",
      "Marten Creek Trail is an oft-overlooked route in summer months that is virtually forgotten come winter. That is a blessing to those who know of, and take advantage of, the beauty of this secluded little forest valley.",
      "Follow a trail up an old mining trail until you get within a boulder filled basin with views of Sloan Peak above you. The first half of the hike is fairly easy, while the second is a steep climb through a creek bed.",
      "While Round Lake, tucked securely in a hidden basin on Lost Creek Ridge, is a wonderful locale, this hike is definitely more about the journey than the destination. After a demanding initial grunt, amble along a mile-high, flower-swaying, peak-packed, view-granting ridge. Savor one of the finest vantages for admiring spiraling Sloan Peak's sprawling sparkling glacier. And if you can ever move your eyes away from this mesmerizing mountain, a multitude of others demand your attention as well.",
      "From Barlow Point’s rocky promontory, hikers can take in views of Mount Dickerman, Big Four, and Stillaguamish Peak.",
      "Perry Creek proves you can have it all in a single hike – old-growth forest, wildflowers, waterfalls, meadows, expansive mountain views, even lakes! Tread lightly, though-due to its unparalleled diversity of native plants, the area between the summits of Stillaguamish Peak, Mount Forgotten, and Mount Dickerman is a research natural area that could (in theory) be closed to all uses but scientific study."

      "Some trails go to lakes, some to high viewpoints. This trail is all about the forest, and what a forest it is! Old-growth trees reach for the sky on either side of a brush-free trail, since understory is minimal when the big old trees block out the light. Find fantastic mushrooms here in the fall and forest wildflowers in the spring and early summer.",
      "Surrounded by a rugged topography cloaked in ancient forest, the setting is as wild as any along the Mountain Loop Highway, except for one noticeable difference. North and Independence lack the crowds that inundate nearby backcountry lakes.",
      "Mount Forgotten is an appealing target for the peculiarly determined hiker-turned-climber. Its sheer wall of a summit is very striking and easily instills visions of alpinism in those headed to Mount Forgotten Meadows, but the route takes a roundabout journey that requires not so much vertiginous daring-do as it does oodles of patience. The views from the top are spectacular, particularly the unobstructed view straight up Glacier Peak.",
      "If the best views come to those who earn them, Mount Dickerman offers the fairest vantage along the Mountain Loop. You’ll huff and puff through 4,000 feet of elevation on your way to the summit; in return, you’ll get a superb panorama of nearly every peak in the Mountain Loop. In late summer, it also rewards the intrepid with a bounty of mountain blueberries.",
      "Vesper Lake is squeezed, like a thumbprint in clay, deep in the saddle between the twin summits of Sperry Peak and Vesper Peak. Rarely is a lake situated so close and steeply below two summits like this–its unique setting gives you remarkably up-close (and straight-up) views of mountainous terrain. And all that comes after the former mining trail that provides incredible scenery along the way.",
      "A nice hike with plenty of variety. Beautiful forest, a rushing creek, waterfalls of all shapes and sizes, history, and of course a large blue-green lake surrounded by snowy peaks. At 10.4 miles, it can be either a day-hike or a quick early season overnight. You won’t be alone, though – this is a popular trail with both hikers and backpackers.",
      "The trail winds its way above the Suiattle River through old-growth forest and some mature forest recovering from an old burn from the 1920’s. The vegetation in the upper Suiattle watershed includes a wonderful mixture of west-of-the-crest/east-fo-the-crest species.",
      "Vesper Peak is definitely not for the novice hiker, but for those thirsting for one step beyond hiking into backcountry adventure, it's a good leaping off point. The smooth, low angle granite of Vesper's upper reaches make for relatively easy off-trail travel and beginning routefinding.",
      "Mount Pugh -- also known by its native name \"Da Klagwats\" -- has one of the most spectacular viewpoints in the North Cascades, offering a vista that includes Glacier and Sloan Peak, Mounts Baker, Shuksan, and Rainier, the Olympics, Monte Cristo, Three Fingers, and White Chuck. The first fire lookout here was established in 1916; a lowly tent perched on the peak until a cabin with a cupola was built in 1922. This was hit by lightning in 1927 and a second lookout was built, but it was subsequently destroyed in 1965 and never rebuilt. Remains of these structures can still be seen on the mountain, when you can tear yourself away from the view.",
      "Rough and tumble is the trail, just like the miners that constructed this path. Though not always easy, the ascent to Gothic Basin, has tremendous rewards. Early on, one simply meanders along side the relentless South Fork of the Sauk. Quickly though this trail will turn to a no-nonsense bee-line to the basin with waterfalls, flowers, and views of the surrounding mountains to keep one distracted. The ultimate rewards come to those who have enough strength to explore the basin after the ascent.",
      "This rugged hike is bound to become a classic, if it isn’t already. The full trail loop provides fantastic views of the Columbia River Gorge, an intimate look at the Cape Horn Falls and a challenging workout as it climbs and descends the rocky slopes of Cape Horn.",
      "The Wenatchee Crest near Blewett Pass is an ideal entry-level snowshoe, thanks to its modest elevation gain and panoramic views from the ridgetop. And even with such an easily accessible trailhead, the crowds are often minimal.",
      "On your next trip to Deception Pass State Park, don’t cross over the Deception Pass bridge. Instead, take the road down to Bowman Bay for some fine hiking along the rugged cliffs. Great views of the bridge over Deception and Canoe Pass, calm Lottie Bay, a woodland walk through hemlock, fir and Pacific Madrone, plus the legend of the Maiden of Deception Pass are what await you here.",
      "Deception Pass State Park is one of the most popular Washington state parks and it is easy to see why. There are beautiful beaches, mature woodlands, great views, lakes, and a beautifully built bridge high on rocks above two narrow waterways. This nice trail will take you through all of this.",
      "Artist Point is the top competitor for best viewpoint in the state. The beautifully shaped Mount Shuksan is the star of the area, with a gorgeous summit pyramid and several impressive glaciers. This relatively easy snowshoe is an excellent winter destination with a virtual guarantee of good snow coverage.",
      "Early in the season, head here. This trail is haphazardly maintained and routefinding on its upper stretches can (and does) prove difficult. But for good routefinders and those who don't mind an occasional deadfall, it's a good early-season route to the high country of Alaska Lake. Even hikers who opt not to push on to Alaska Lake will enjoy the valley hike as it explores the creek basin and its multitude of beaver ponds and flower-filled clearings.",
      "Waterfalls, wildflowers, sheltering forests, mountain views and an alpine lake are offered on this well-maintained trail. At the lake, enjoy the sights and relax for a while. If you backpacked in, stay at the campsites for a sunrise and sunset on the lake.",
      "Seattle's Discovery Park Loop Trail is a designated National Recreation Trail, 2.8 miles long with an elevation change of just 140 feet. It passes through both forest and open meadows, offers extensive views, good prospects for bird watchers, and it can be hiked or jogged year-round.",
      "The Cape Alava Loop (Ozette Triangle) is two hikes in one: a forest stroll and a walk on the beach. Take the Cape Alava Trail out to the beach and back for a 6.2 mile hike, or continue south along the beach to connect up with the Sand Point Trail for a 9.4 mile loop.",
      "Hike a short but steep trail with many stone steps. Pause at a viewpoint offering a fine view of Mount Rainier, then continue on to Poo Poo Point itself, only 1.9 miles from the trailhead. Enjoy views to the northwest, and perhaps watch paragliders sailing off into the sky.",
      "Tired of the freeway noise hiking in the I-90 corridor? If you are willing to drive an addition 30 minutes east from the pass, Rachel Lake offers a spectacular, relatively quiet alpine hike. From Rachel Lake you can access further adventures at Rampart Lake, Lila Lake and Alta Peak. This hike is a popular weekend overnight destination; so don’t expect to be by yourself in high season.",
      "The trailhead for this section of the John Wayne Pioneer Trail is found just south of Spokane and west of Tekoa.",
      "Well, how about a hike, pilgrim? The John Wayne Pioneer Trail in Iron Horse State Park provides access to notable North Bend hikes, views of mountains and waterfalls, and a journey back into Washington’s history. Take in the wildlife and cross soaring bridges as you make a level traverse from Rattlesnake Lake to Change and Hall Creeks 5.5 miles to the east.",
      "Stroll a paved path or walk the lakeshore to find the remains of Moncton, now part of the Rattlesnake Lake Recreation Area near North Bend. Moncton was once a stop along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, also known as the Milwaukee Road. The town became Rattlesnake Lake in 1915 when Masonry Dam was constructed on the hillside above.",
      "Walk along an old railroad grade that climbs gently though forested hillsides. In summer, look for wildflowers: blackberry, elderberry, pea, daisy, buttercup, and wild rose.",
      "Carne Mountain is a challenging, yet rewarding hike to the brilliant gold colors of the western larches. Against a backdrop of blue autumn sky and indigo mountains, they are a dazzling sight.",
      "Washington State has a plethora of amazingly beautiful trails for the avid hiker to tread, but how many take you through an old train tunnel more than two miles long? The Snoqualmie Tunnel is part of the Iron Horse State Park's 110-mile long trail and is a must do for everyone! Views for most of your trip will be determined by the power of your headlamp, but there will be some sights on the other side. Note that the tunnel is closed November 1st through May 1st, so plan your trip accordingly.",
      "A popular trail, thanks to its gentle, family friendly grade with amazing destinations. The natural water slide area at Denny Creek is a must visit for families! Keekwulee Falls offers a stunning viewpoint that is easily accessible. Snowshoe Falls maybe a bit elusive and more difficult to see from the trail, but is also a beautiful natural wonder.",
      "Great views, a canyon beneath spectacular cliffs, buttresses and pinnacles of weathered basalt, wildflowers in the spring, color and wildlife in the autumn, and sunshine through most of the day in the winter make the Point 3582-Waterworks Canyon loop on Mount Cleman a great hike.",
      "Since getting to the trailhead involves a significant drive on gravel road, this hike sees fewer boots than trails leaving from Paradise and Sunrise. Spray Falls is attainable by most day hikers, but the gain up to Spray Park is a good test of your fitness level! Your reward on a clear day will be views, views, views of Echo Rock, Observation Rock and Mount Rainier."

      "A great trip in the summer or winter, the Gondola at Crystal Mountain is also open for snowshoeing! At the lodge, you can obtain a \"Scenic Pass\" that is good for one trip up and down. This pass is for pedestrians only. On a clear day, one can see Mounts Adams, St. Helens, Baker, Glacier Peak, the Olympics, and everything in between.",
      "Hike through forest, then up steep, open slopes to a magnificent ridge top.",
      "This pleasant Vancouver trail follows Burnt Bridge Creek through a variety of landscapes, including open grasslands, wetlands, and forests. Nature lovers use the trail to watch waterfowl, listen to song birds, and perhaps spot a coyote or deer. The eight-mile greenbelt has multiple access points, allowing this hard-surfaced trail to be conveniently divided into sections.",
      "Mount Rainier's Westside Road is closed in winter at the junction with Highway 706, making this road showshoe more than 11 miles roundtrip.",
      "You’ll not meet any hunters in Indian Henry’s Hunting Ground these days, but the area is named for one of the most prominent Native American guides in the area, who lived here before it became a national park. Accessible via Longmire or the West Side road, this destination promises abundant wildflowers and berries, and excellent up-close views of \"The Mountain.\"",
      "",
      "More than 5000 acres of marshes, grasslands and wooded areas are home to more than one hundred species of birds, waterfowl and fish. Two trails and a loop road provide public access to this serene area just a few miles west of I-5. Spring and fall are the best seasons to see migrating songbirds and shorebirds, but summer offers the additional attraction of the barrier-free Kiwa Loop Trail.",
      "Featuring a wooded canyon and forested hills, a salmon-bearing stream and new community garden, Swan Creek Park is a 290-acre greenspace which lies on the boundary between East Tacoma and Pierce County. Trails, both paved and soft-surface, as well as those for mountain bikes weave over the property.",
      "Lacamas Lake Park is a diverse natural area with a surprisingly 'wild' feel for a park this close to town. Picnic by the lake, check out the Camas meadow in bloom, or explore the forest and creeks along the many trails. This hike describes a \"lollipop\" loop starting at the south end of the park, visiting the Lower Falls, then circling around through the park past Round Lake and returning along Lacamas Creek.",
      "This is a well used trail for trail runners and some bikers. Mostly gravel, it is wide and well-groomed.",
      "A birder's paradise, this wildlife refuge is the perfect get-away without a long drive. The refuge includes mixed wetlands and pastures with riparian strips lined with cottonwoods and white oak trees. More than 200 species of waterfowl and songbirds have been recorded here, making it the perfect place to slow down and enjoy nature.",
      "A deep-forest experience without the drive. Whipple Creek Park is a 300-acre green oasis in the midst of farmlands to the west of the Clark County Fairgrounds. This hike loops through colossal Douglas fir trees and waist-high sword ferns to provide a primordial experience where you are dwarfed by nature. There is a small meadow for a picnic and the remnants of a grist mill to explore. This hike is a great way to escape urban life and be immersed in a peaceful forest environment.",
      "Columbia Springs is open to the public daily from dawn until dusk. There is a large permeable-paved public parking lot on the west side of the property. Located on the site is the historic Vancouver Trout Hatchery. Visitors can explore historical and interpretive displays, walk the nature trails, observe birds and other wildlife, feed the fish in the display pond, and picnic. Visiting Columbia Springs is free!",
      "This is a perfect route when the snows have been falling heavy and low down on the hills.",
      "Want a walk through a gorgeous winter wonderland without a sweaty climb up a steep trail? This route offers all the beauty and majesty found in the wintry mountains without the strenuous workout usually required to see such splendor. It is perfect for taking the family on a gentle snowshoe stroll or for introducing newbies to the joys of snowshoeing.",
      "Hike a service road to the top of Squak Mountain in Issaquah.",
      "The South District of the Mount Tahoma Trails Association (MTTA) network offers spectacular snow recreation, even though you're seldom above 4500 feet.",
      "A gentle meandering barrier-free path leads through a mature cottonwood forest just west of Vancouver Lake. Although you can't see the lake through all the trees, there are other sights and sounds to enjoy along this route. Most notably the vibrant greens of the understory in spring, beautiful fall yellows and quite a few species of birds nearly all year.",
      "If ever there was a hike to satisfy all a hiker's desires, this one comes as close as any. A loop hike with many fabulous changing faces throughout the seasons, Heather-Maple Pass features ridgelines blanketed in wildflowers in summer, lakes ringed with golden larches in fall, and before the highway closes for the season, a dramatic place to experience early winter’s snows.",
      "The Big Quilcene Trail to Marmot Pass is one of the most popular trails in the Olympic National Forest. What many hikers don't realize is that it was once twice as long. The road delivering them to the trailhead severed it in two. Good news, though, the entire trail still exists, the eastern 6 miles now known as the Lower Big Quilcene Trail. And although not in the Buckhorn Wilderness, it's still quite wild in places. Much of the route runs through a rugged canyon cloaked in primeval forest. And while past logging has eaten away at the periphery, plenty of ancient groves grace the way.",
      "In Sahale Arm, the forces of nature have conspired to create an improbably gentle, gorgeous landscape. A scenic trail ambles peacefully through rolling alpine meadows blanketing the broad shoulder of Sahale Mountain. This park-like setting is made all the more spectacular by contrast with the dramatic mountainous terrain that stretches off in every direction near and far. Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful hikes in all of Washington.",
      "Bring a tide table and a good book on this scenic traverse of the wild Olympic Coast. While much of your hike will be across sandy beaches, there are several places that will require you wait for the tide to go out. Along the way, plan to climb up steep headlands with cable ladders, ropes and your hands and knees. It's a challenge, but a good one.",
      "This is a short hike to a beautiful 2 tiered falls along Mosier Creek on the Oregon side of the Columbia River Gorge.",
      "There are two routes up the north side of Silver Star Mountain that in good conditions can be combined to form a sort of loop. Along the way, hikers will be delighted with a diverse array of wildflowers, a natural arch, volcanic views and fine hiking.",
      "The user-created trail that passed through private lands at the base of the cliff has been closed by the Forest Service. Please respect the closure. For information about other trails at Coyote Wall, please see WTA's Hiking Guide entries for Coyote Wall - Moab/Maui Loop and Coyote Wall - The Labyrinth Loop.",
      "Located just outside of the Wenatchee city limits, Jacobson Preserve is part of the very small percentage (3%!) of historic, undisturbed shrub-steppe in Washington. Here you'll find rabbitbrush, Sagebrush, Arrowhead balsamroot and antelope bitterbrush, all main sources of food for muledeer. The area is so important, in fact, that it has been established as important habitat for the deer, and there are three monitoring points in the preserve to observe the shrub steppe as it is being reclaimed to native habitat.",

      "",
      "",
      "Hike a huckleberry-dotted trail to the summit of Mount Spokane for views of lush forest, farmland, and lakes. You can even explore the site of an old fire lookout.",
      "An up and down meandering trail that leads through open forest, wildflower meadows and a side trip to some fantastic views. The road up does most of the work, so the climb is not too long, and can be easily done by most hikers.",
      "Enjoy a swim in a nice quiet lake surrounded by forest. Due to the narrow road, lack of spectacular scenery and few campsites, this lake does not get as many visitors as other hikes in the area do. The trail receives little maintenance so it is a bit rough, but it is easily followed.",
      "A 4-5 day backpack up the tumbling, boisterous, river-like Thunder Creek from the Colonial Creek Campground to just beyond its headwaters at Park Creek Pass. Backpackers can turn around at Park Creek Pass (45.6 miles) or do a traverse to Cascade Pass (41.8 miles).",
      "This last leg of the PCT (or first depending on whether you're north- or southbound) offers breathtaking views as it passes along the eastern edge of the North Cascades and into the Pasayten Wilderness. Make sure to bring your passport to complete your journey in Manning Provincial Park!",
      "At Cascade Pass, the wow factor far exceeds the “ow” factor – perhaps no other trail in the state delivers as much reward for the effort. From the high peaks on either side of the pass, verdant meadows curve down to a saddle that offers sweeping views of nearby valleys, glaciers, mountains, and passing wildlife. Sedately climbing a little less than 1,800 feet in 3.6 miles, it is the perfect hike to show new hikers the extraordinary places their feet can take them.",
      "A steep as all heck hike (about 1200' per mile) from the Twisp River Valley up to Abernathy Ridge with 360degree views. Trail continues on to Slate Lake (add 4 miles RT for a total of 10 miles if you do this option.)",
      "By far the most difficult stretch of PCT in Washington, Section K puts hikers through a grueling 117-mile trek over harsh terrain and treacherous conditions. Yet those intrepid enough to attempt it are rewarded with a true wilderness experience in and among some of the country's most pristine and beautiful surroundings.",
      "Meander along this path to a loud and misty falls near Newhalem which offer a great respite from heat on hot summer afternoons.",
      "An \"shortcut\" trail connecting the Wynoochee Pass trail near Wynoochee Pass to the Graves Creek trail below Lake Sundown.",
      "Take a beautifully constructed boardwalk a little more than three miles out to the wild Olympic Coast. If you can snag a permit, camping here is divine. If not, while away a few hours playing in the water or ambling along the beach.",
      "The East Crater Trail is a heavily used connector to the Pacific Crest Trail that also provides relatively easy access to the heart of the Indian Heaven Wilderness.",
      "The Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge protects a portion of the ‘Channeled Scablands’ of ice age flood fame. The refuge has a 5.5 mile auto route through part of it. This makes a comfortable undulating loop for hikers.",
      "A classic hike in any season, but come in winter and you’ll find that the hordes of tourists, hikers, and climbers who use this trail in the summer have dwindled to just a trickle.",
      "The Finch Arboretum is a 65-acre park found just minutes southwest of downtown Spokane. The site is an extensive botanical and tree garden with more than 2,000 labeled ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowers.",
      "There’s a hidden valley in Washington’s Glacier Peak Wilderness that some have likened to Shangri-La, the fictional utopia of James Hilton’s novel Lost Horizon. Hilton’s Shangri-La is the Napeequa River Valley, and perhaps the best place to look down on the Napeequa is from Little Giant Pass.",
      "Enchantment Park is part of a large network of different trails and parks located along the Wenatchee River in downtown Leavenworth. The trails are well maintained, and dotted with informative plaques all along their length.",
      "Used primarily by mountain bikers, this trail is very popular due to its proximity to the town of Leavenworth. It is also frequently used as a logging road, and is subject to occasional closures because of this.",
      "This is an easy walk on a wide gravel and boardwalk path to views of Big Four Mountain and the caves beneath the snow. Hikers of all ages and abilities can enjoy this trail.",
      "A beautiful and easy hike for anyone who wants to explore the north region of Lake Chelan and all the treasures it has to offer.",
      "An alternate, less steep route to Mount Si",
      "You'll work up a sweat on this easy to moderate hike to the spectacular Teneriffe Falls (formerly Kamikaze Falls). Go in the spring when the tread is snow-free and the waterfall is flowing at full volume. Along the way, you'll be rewarded with views of the surrounding Snoqualmie valley and nearby peaks. With limited parking at the trailhead, this trail doesn’t get too crowded. It's a nice alternative to neighboring Little Si and Mt. Si if you are looking for a quiet hike near North Bend.",
      "Companion piece to neighbor and big brother Mount Si, the small rocky bluff known as Little Si is a moderate grade 4.7 mile trail located in the hike rich North Bend area. Although relatively steep inclines bookend this hike, this primarily North/South route is perfect for beginners who are looking to get back in shape, while still accommodating veterans with opportunities to cut away on the Boulder Garden Loop (at .3 miles and .5 miles) to merge with the more challenging Mount Si trail. Expect crowds, even in winter, as New Year’s resolutions (the two Si mountains are sometimes colloquially referred to as the “Resolution Peaks” for the deluge of hikers that appear after January 1st), proximity to the city and a degree of refuge from the elements often divert heavy foot traffic to this mini-mountain to keep it busy year round.",
      "There are many reasons – besides its proximity to Seattle – why Mount Si is the most popular hike in the state: beautiful views, wildlife (some of it not so wild), old growth forest, and a dramatic summit worthy of a more remote peak. Rising dramatically above the Snoqualmie Valley, it serves as a literal and figurative gateway to the Cascades for thousands of hikers.",
      "Stagman Ridge is a long spine reaching out southwest from Mount Adams, and the hike through the pleasing forest is never overly steep.",
      "The iconic Palouse Falls that has been deemed the official waterfall of Washington State is not to be missed. There are trails aplenty at Palouse Falls State Park with outstanding views of the waterfall fit for the whole family."

      "This trail begins with an amazing, ADA accessible, interpretive trail before proceeding down a steep rugged canyon to a one-of-a-kind swinging bridge.",
      "This North Idaho interpretive trail is easily accessible from I-90 and is not-to-be missed for its rich history of the 1910 fires.",
      "The old trail up Mailbox Peak was the stuff of legend. It inspired potential Rainier climbers, challenged adventurous day hikers, and occasionally Mother Nature used the trail to bite back. The number of injuries and rescues on the old trail prompted the Department of Natural Resources to create a new trail to the top. While still relatively steep, this new route, built in part with help from WTA volunteers offers a more easily navigable way for folks to attain the summit of this formidable peak.",
      "Visit Hawk Creek in the winter to amble along its shoreline, or in the summertime for vistas of incredible geologic landmarks.",
      "This is a prime example of a desert hiking area that offers many hours of slow wandering and contemplation of the unique environment, even though the mileage isn't as great as some other areas. You'll find exciting geological formations and history as you explore the huge canyon/coulee that holds the Twin Lakes.",
      "The sign outside the Manresa Grotto states simply: \"A beautiful grotto exists.\" And it's true! It does exist, and while it's beautiful in its own way, it can be a little creepy when one visits alone on a rainy day.",
      "From mountain peak to Wild and Scenic River, this long loop takes in a range of terrain, wildlife and views.",
      "WTA helped build a new trail on the Republic Ranger District of the Colville National Forest.",
      "Beginning at a large intersection of Forest Service road 3500, the Wildon Creek Trail meanders along a plateau of lodgepole pines. At the end of this trail, you'll be at the junction with the High Creek trail and further adventures.",
      "Hike to a high hidden valley housing one of the largest alpine lakes in the Sawtooth Range. Under the watchful eyes of 7742-foot Rennie Peak, an 8000-plus-foot nameless neighbor and a junta of jagged pinnacles, Louis Lake's lofty surroundings are quite stunning. But despite such a rugged setting, the trek to Louis is most agreeable. Hoof this way in early summer before the horses arrive and enjoy a dazzling floral show as an added bonus.",
      "A scramble up Courtney Peak in the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness. While not as tall as some of the surrounding peaks, it is widely regarded as having the best view in the wilderness.",
      "Winter, while frequently bitterly cold here, offers unique hiking opportunities. Dress warmly and you'll enjoy exploring the snow-dappled sagelands. This area serves as a winter stopping area for trumpeter swans, cranes, geese, mergansers, goldeneyes, canvasbacks, and other migrating waterfowl.",
      "The BLM showed good sense in preserving this wonderful, if small, slice of desert paradise. Wilson Creek flows south of Govan (past an old turn-of-the-nineteenth-century schoolhouse in Govan). From the south access trailhead, you'll find a lovely trail, great wildflowers, wonderful views up and down the Wilson Creek coulee, and an incredible vantage from which to view wildlife: owls, prairie falcons, northern harriers, red-tailed and rough-legged hawks, warblers, white-crowned and golden-crowned sparrows, horned larks, meadowlarks, mountain bluebirds--it pays to visit in different seasons!",
      "The Swanson Lake Wildlife Area is a magical desert oasis. Between gorgeous expanses of sageland, you'll find fantastic pools of water, sparkling like gems on the desert floor. These jewels not only reflect the glorious beauty surrounding them, but they also draw in another type of beauty: a bounty of wildlife.",
      "Wherever you find water in the desert, you'll find wildlife, and this route offers further proof of that. With many small pools, puddles, and marshes formed by a series of seeps oozing from the ground, this part of the Swanson Lakes Wildlife Area is rich in wildlife.",
      "Boyer Park, nestled along the banks of the Snake River, offers great hiking in the transition zone between the river and the sageland country above. The established trail provides a great outing in and of itself, but adventurous hikers can cross the road and ramble cross-country onto the slopes above the river, heading up to rimrock bluffs at the top of the canyon wall.",
      "Hike an old sheep drive high into the roadless Granite Mountain hinterlands. Along the way traverse lonely meadows bursting with wildflowers. Take in views of the Okanogan Highlands and some of the least-known and hiked peaks in the state. The Conconully Reservoir sparkles below, set against rolling golden hills on the eastern edge of the North Cascades.",
      "This short, flat paved trail takes curious hikers less than 100 yards to the Potters Pond Fishing and Observation Platform. From here, enjoy watching a wide variety of birds and fish play and dive in the skies and water. Keep an eye out for the resident pair of bald eagles, or raptors flying the thermals above the cliffs near Bayley Lake just south of the pond.",
      "On this remote hike in the Colville National Forest, you'll find wooded trails and panoramic views of the Columbia River, the Pend Oreille Valley, and Deep Creek.",
      "Hike to a viewpoint on the Kettle Crest trail that was the site of a former fire lookout.",
      "Go north on the Kettle Crest National Scenic Trail across the southwestern flank of Columbia Mountain. The open summit, the high point for this adventure, holds views of the surrounding Kettle Range.",
      "The Alpine Lakes Wilderness may be reached from numerous trail heads along the I-90 corridor. This little trail-gem sparkles, hidden just the other side of Snoqualmie Pass. It varies in terrain from abandoned logging road, through clear cut, all the way up to pristine alpine lake(s) nestled into a glacier scoured cirque. Seasonal changes make this medium difficulty hike worth returning to time and time again.",
      "With two small lakes and numerous branching trails that sport views to Mount Baker and the Puget Sound, this moderate trail through shady forest can be hiked or backpacked year round. Trails circle both of these lakes, and on nice days you’ll find people out fishing or canoeing here.",
      "A short but stiff climb through an old burn, old growth forest, and alpine meadows to a restored fire lookout standing sentinel over the western flanks of the Wild Sky Wilderness.",
      "This loop takes you past two clear and calm lakes, up a steep, brushy trail to the beautifully manicured Pacific Crest Trail, then west under the blocky granite summit of Tinkham Peak and the shining pyramid of Silver Peak before dropping to Windy Pass.",
      "The view from Silver Star Mountain is one of the best around. Sitting in the center of the Chinook Trail System near Battle Ground, Silver Star offers expansive vistas from the get-go, and is one of the absolute best spots in Southwest Washington for wildflowers in the springtime. The catch: you’d better have a high clearance vehicle, because you have to drive one of the worst roads in the state of Washington to access it.",
      "Take a short dayhike in a ghost forest to a beautiful babbling brook on the southwest side of Mount St. Helens.",
      "A beautiful waterfall flows out of Lake Serene and cascades below the rugged east wall of Mount Index at the end ofa trail on the west side of Bridal Veil Creek. Take time to see and enjoy a stunning view of Bridal Veil Falls and climb flights of steps paralleling the falls. Children will be fascinated as they stand directly beside the water and look up a 100-foot rock face to see the streams of water that make up the bridal veil pouring beside them. An old nearby mine, the Honeymoon Mine, brought the original nineteenth-century travelers to the Lake Serene area.",
      "The curiously-named Lake Twentytwo is the center of an oasis of alpine wetland nestled on the northern shoulder of Mount Pilchuck. The hike to the lake combines the best of mountain rainforests, old-growth, wetlands, and mountain views, yet it is readily accessible. In winter the route lends itself to snowshoeing.",
      "Originally home to the Suquamish Indian tribe and legendary for being the supposed birthplace of Chief Sealth, over the years Blake Island has also served as a timber source, a private estate, Army base, and even a smuggler’s refuge. It now may be best known for Tillicum Village, a Native American re-enactment retreat accessible via ferry from nearby Seattle."

      "Bridle Trails State Park offers more than 28 miles of pleasant, forested trails conveniently located between Bellevue and Kirkland.",
      "Despite its intermediate difficulty, Mount Pilchuck sees a slew of visitors in a given year, as hikers flock to the trail for its grand panoramic views and historic restored fire lookout. Easily one of the most rewarding hikes in the area, its relatively short 2.7 mile, 2,300 feet ascent gifts you 360-degree views of Mount Baker, Mount Rainier and the Olympics from its shelter lookout, which sits nestled on a summit that tops out around 5,300 feet. This calf-friendly journey is all made possible by a high elevation trailhead, which sets you off on your travels around 3,000 feet, cutting what would otherwise be an arduous ten mile roundtrip in half.",
      "Begin with a walk over a bouncy suspension bridge above the trout-rich waters of the Yakima River. This trail meanders up an ever-narrowing canyon, but it also seems to be a path to the past.",
      "Millersylvania State Park sports camping, boating and more than 8 miles of hiking trails. The trails zigzag all around, so you are probably able to construct a loop of up to 5 miles - or less. The huge old growth cedar and fir, easy accessibility to I-5 and excellent opportunity for a pleasant walk in the woods make this an attractive place to hike, especially in winter.",
      "Excellent groomed Nordic Trails in winter convert to a nice double track trail for summer use. The trails are Nordic-only in winter (no snowshoeing allowed), but multi-use in summer (hike, bike, & equestrian).",
      "There are plenty of interesting things to see at Fort Ebey, and lots of trails to take you there. A beach walk, bluff views, a lake, forest, and history can all be found here. The park has 26 miles of trails, allowing you to put together a very interesting hike, either long or short, that includes most or all of the sights. This loop of approximately four miles will take you on a nice tour.",
      "While snow still coats the high places of the Methow Valley, the hike to Black Lake offers early-season wildflowers amidst the recovery from a devastating 2003 wildfire.",
      "Table Mountain's dramatic south face and pyramid profile beckon the adventurous hiker ready for a strenuous climb that is good training for summer summit attempts to come. The top features one of the best panoramas of the Columbia River Gorge, as well as views of Mount St. Helens, Rainier, Hood and Adams. Carry a guidebook with good route information as there are a couple of options to the summit and signage may be lacking.",
      "Located in Central Oregon, this delightful hike in an extremely popular state park is a great day hike diversion for those hoping to venture deeper into Oregon.",
      "This trail stays just outside Mount Rainier National Park, but the highlights of the trek are the outstanding views east to the glaciers that cover the west flank of the big volcano. The trail is relatively flat and open, though at times the tread is rough and brushy--maintenance of the trail is a once-in-a-while occurrence. Fortunately, the path is easy to follow and offers a wonderfully unique view of Mount Rainier. Few people get to see the west face of the mountain from this close. Since the trail is completely outside the park, dogs are welcome on it.",
      "Sun drenched ridgelines, blooming trillium, and sparkling alpine waters define this fitting tribute to one of Washington’s greatest trail advocates.",
      "The volcanic eruption swept away the forest, and the massive mudflows in the Toutle River Basin created a huge earthen dam that trapped the waters of Coldwater Creek and formed the new lake. This area is still very fragile, and hikers should stay on the established trail.",
      "Mount Townsend offers rhododendrons in May and June, wildflowers June through August, then berries in August and September and fall colors in, well, fall. Add in old growth, some tucked away waterfalls, and a windswept, turtleback summit with views north across the Strait and San Juans, west and south into and along the Olympics and east across the Sound to the Cascades, and you've got the perfect year-round hike.",
      "After you've explored a few trails with your little one, the Heather Lake trail makes a wonderful next step. It's the perfect place to take children on their first ‘real’ hike. The trail is short, but steep and challenging--it'll give a child a real sense of accomplishment once they reach the lake. The lake itself is a scenic little lake located on the northeastern slope of Mount Pilchuck.",
      "Heybrook Lookout is a short and moderately steep hike through a fern and moss covered forest to a fun, staircase-ridden lookout with great views of the nearby mountains. If you are introducing someone to hiking, limited on time, or trying to add on another hike or activity in the area, this is the hike for you.",
      "A leisurely, kid-friendly jaunt to a quiet body of water teeming with wildlife, or a more moderate push through ancient forest along a crashing waterway-it's your choice. The forests of Big Creek, like those throughout the Quinault Valley, are impressive. Over 140 inches of rain fall here each year, saturating the forest floor and supporting massive cedars, lofty firs, hovering hemlocks, and clumps of shoulder-high ferns. Elk are abundant in this verdant valley, while hikers remain scarce.",
      "Hike along a wild river sporting big bends and wide gravel bars that'll have you thinking you're in Alaska. Massive Sitka spruce, gargantuan western hemlocks, and corridors of mossy maples and speckled alders grace the way. Retrace part of the Press Expedition's 1889-90 route across the Olympics, and visit the former site of a lodge that provided warmth and hospitality to trekkers during the 1920s and '30s. Along the North Fork Quinault River, you can embrace the pure wildness and raw beauty of the Olympic rain forest.",
      "Reclaimed railroad grade through Kirkland with urban and forest scenery.",
      "Lila Lake is a beautiful lake surrounded by parkland and jagged mountains. While it can be done as a day hike, it is better enjoyed as an overnight destination. Nearby Alta Mountain and Rampart Lakes make excellent side trips.",
      "The stunning views and unparalleled springtime flowers make this one of the most popular hikes in the Gorge. On a good day, you can get a bird’s eye view of Mount Hood and the Columbia River. In the spring the top is carpeted with vibrant yellow balsam root. Although the trail is steep and sometimes crowded, this hike is unquestionably worth the effort.",
      "Climb through rich, old growth forest to miles of some of the finest ridge walking available in Washington, where alpine meadows and jaw-dropping views abound.",
      "When it comes to resplendent alpine meadows, the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness can't be beat. And when it comes to the finest flower romps within that wild area named for the longtime Washington senator and champion of conservation, Cady Ridge ranks supreme. A multitude of blossoms proliferate along this mile-high ridge. But it's the lupines that dominate, transforming Cady into a purple mountain majesty. And views! From the inspiring Poet Peaks, to the emerald-cloaked summits along the Cascade crest, to cloud-piercing, snow-catching, ice-harboring, horizon-dominating Glacier Peak!",
      "Visit one of the most striking lakes in the Henry M. Jackson wilderness. The vibrant blue of the glacier-fed lake provides the perfect rest stop for hikers who have braved the thirty-odd, steep switchbacks that lead to the lake.",
      "The Green Lake Trail is a moderately strenuous but relatively short hike to a pocket lake set among a rare high-elevation rain forest. The trail's wide, ambitious grade rewards accordingly for your efforts, ascending through stands of humbling firs, passing a picturesque waterfall, and ending on the shore of a lovely mountain lake.",
      "Bird Creek Meadows is a short, easy crowd pleaser. Known for its abundant wildflower meadows, views of Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood and the Hellroaring Canyon, and little creeks, lakes and waterfalls, the trail provides a nice 3-mile loop for hikers.",
      "Pine forests give way to basalt lava beds as you climb east along the Pacific Crest Trail to the timberline on graceful Mount Adams. This wonderfully formed mountain is one of the youngest of the big volcanoes, and as such, hasn't yet lost its smooth cone shape to the forces of erosion. The only thing that could make the mountain more attractive is to see it reflected in the cold waters of a wilderness lake. Looking Glass can't truthfully be called a lake-it's far too small for that-but when the winds are calm and the air is clear, the tiny tarn does reflect the face of Adams as well as any looking glass.",
      "One of the most popular routes on Mount Rainier for its varied terrain, wide-open meadows, and incredible views, this 17-mile one-way hike along the mountain’s eastern side showcases the kind of scenery that will have you doing happy little dances of joy from one stunning panorama to the next.",
      "",
      "Hike along old logging roads to a 25-foot tall waterfall on Cherry Creek just outside of Duvall. Note that access to this area is part of an easement with nearby homeowners, and part of the trail is on private land, so please remain on the main path, observe leash laws and keep noise to a minimum as a courtesy to home-owners along trail.",
      "Hike a prominent peak that hovers over the crystal-clear waters of Lake Crescent. A World War II enemy airplane spotter cabin still teeters on the precipitous summit. Trees have overtaken the wide views once afforded to lookout personnel, but nearby ledges still offer breathtaking glimpses straight down to the lake and out across to Mount Storm King. Graced with a microclimate of mild temperatures and moderate precipitation, the trail to Pyramid Mountain melts out early, providing peak-probing hiking in la primavera."

      "You may have heard Mailbox Peak mentioned in slightly hushed tones, the kind reserved for stories about some legendary storm or a bad accident. What inspires such reverence? The original route, which entails 4,000 feet of climbing in less than three miles. The newer, gentler trail takes twice as much distance to achieve the summit, but nothing will permanently erase the original trail's fearsome reputation.",
      "Along with the numerous other I-90 hikes there is no shortage of ‘workout’ on this hike. Like its counterparts, this trail is largely for those interested in heading up, steeply. Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.",
      "This lesser known trail starts in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and then enters the northeast corner of the park, is snow-free early in the season and goes through some amazing old growth.",
      "Lake Serene and Bridal Veil Falls compete for attention on this 7.2 mile trip. Either would be a worthy destination by themselves and combined they are a great day on the trail.",
      "From the Moorage at Beacon Rock State Park this short connector trail climbs through tall Douglas-fir trees, through the site of an old homestead and Filbert Orchard, then past Ridell Lake on its way to the namesake Rock. Its a great hike for people who arrive at the park by boat or for anyone wanting to make a longer hike of the 1.0 mile Beacon Rock Trail.",
      "Beacon Rock's native name is \"Che-Che-op-tin,\" which translates to \"the navel of the world.\" Native Americans weren't far off in their comparison, since the 848-foot basalt column once formed the core, or belly, of an ancient volcano.",
      "Approximately nine miles of family friendly trails for hiking, with some multi use trails as well are accessible just outside of Mount Vernon. The trails here are close to town, but feel far removed, with beautiful views of the Skagit Valley from the summit.",
      "A quiet trail for those looking for a moderate two to three hour hike.The first section is quiet, narrow, and solitary, while the second section is wider, airy and with more traffic, both human and animal.",
      "**The trail is closed between first overlook with benches (0.75 from miles from west trailhead) to the west end of the Twin Falls Canyon Bridge (1.75 miles from west trailhead) due to several hazards that make the trail dangerous for hikers. Hikers who wish to visit Twin Falls can access the east end of the Twin Falls Trail from the Homestead Valley Trailhead located off of I-90 Exit 38 (50501 SE Homestead Valley Rd, North Bend, WA 98045).",
      "This hike has deep forest, pretty mountain lakes, fall color, and plenty of good trail to walk on without watching your feet all the time.",
      "Scorpion Mountain offers a 360-degree view of the Central Cascades, and the huckleberries and blueberries make this a much underrated fall hike.",
      "This short hike to a lake in the Boulder River Wilderness is a great trail for families.",
      "The Hardy Ridge hike makes use of the old logging roads that wind through the backcountry or the park north of Highway 14. These routes are closed to vehicles but open to equestrians, mountain bikers and hikers. A WTA built single-track trail traverses the ridge offering a wide vista of the Columbia River Gorge.",
      "This little-known gem of a hike on the Washington side of the Columbia River Gorge offers spectacular views of the Columbia River, amazing spring wildflowers and an old garry oak forest of gnarled old trees. This stunning preserve is owned by the Friends of the Columbia Gorge and tops out in an old cherry orchard with a few surviving trees.",
      "This is a hike to a two-tiered waterfall located in a fairyland grotto with many large moss covered boulders.",
      "Forest Park has miles and miles of trails from the wide gravel road Leif Erickson Drive to narrow single-track routes like the Hardesty or the Nature Trail.",
      "The Big Lava Bed is the home of an old lava flow-magma oozed out of fis-sures and cracks in the heart of the Lava Bed (as well as along the lower flanks of Mount Adams, in the southern Indian Heaven area, and of course, around Mount St. Helens). The flows began some 9000 years ago and, as Mount St. Helens showed, volcanic activity in the area is still occurring. The Big Lava Bed is a volcanic formation, but it's not the classic conical volcano. Rather, it is a 20-square-mile flow of basalt that flowed out of a source vent found in the north-central part of the bed, just south of Goose Lake.",
      "Get a different view of the perennially-popular Mount Si on the Talus Loop Trail. Just under 4 miles long, the Talus Trail explores the eastern slopes of the mountain. You'll hike briefly with the crowds headed to the haystack, then peel off and enjoy a much quieter forest walk, along with a good workout.",
      "Hiking with kids, new to hiking, or just looking for an easy day hike with a spectacular endpoint? Look no further then Franklin Falls! At just 2 miles with 400 feet in elevation gain it is the perfect destination for any hiker looking for something easy and beautiful!",
      "One of the largest petrified forests on the planet sits in the center of Washington State. The ancient trees were mineralized into rock during the great lava flows that swept the inland Northwest. In addition to petrified ginkgos (one of the oldest tree species in the world), the \"rock forest\" includes mineralized Douglas fir, spruce, walnut, and elm.",
      "Whether you need a day hike for the whole family or the perfect trail to round out your first visit to Olympic National Park, Hurricane Hill is the answer. You can even use this trail as the jumpoff (or ending point) to a variety of longer hikes out of the Elwha River Valley.",
      "Just west of the town of Leavenworth, the Tumwater Pipeline Trail offers a lovely riverside ramble at any time of year. Enjoy the high waters and flowers blooming in spring, photograph vivid color in fall, and try out your snowshoes in winter. Whatever the season, this is a beautiful, short walk for those looking for something easy and quick.",
      "The Ice Cave and Natural Bridges are two short nature trails near the Peterson Prairie Campground in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest that are fascinating to children and not as well known as they deserve to be. This is also a popular area to cross country ski and snowshoe in winter.",
      "Hike through a pastoral area first settled and farmed in the 1880s. Along the way, enjoy a dense grove of cedars, followed by close-up views of blueberry fields that still produce an annual crop. Circle Larsen Lake, and view a restored pioneer home. Optionally, extend your hike to view nearby Phantom Lake.",
      "The Teanaway is a fabulous drainage with year-round opportunities. Koppen sits on an easily accessed ridge line which lacks the crowds of many of the other hikes in this area. Commanding views of the Stuart Range, and further away, the Pacific Crest make for stunning scenery. Although this trail’s rewards are an end unto itself, it may also easily be combined with numerous other peaks, ridgelines, or drainages for longer loop trails.",
      "Considered one of the best loop hikes in Mount Rainier National Park, the trail through the alpine meadows of Spray and Seattle Parks blazes with a bounty of seasonal wildflowers. Throw in an ample serving of glassy tarns, a couple of wispy waterfalls, an optional side trip to Carbon Glacier and a forested stroll up Ipsut Creek, and you have a photographer’s dreamland.",
      "",
      "Expansive views of Mount Rainier, up-close views of Emmons Glacier, lakes, and campsites are just a few features of the Glacier Basin Loop's varying landscape.",
      "A clear, sparkling lake, up-close views of Mount Rainier, and a historic fire lookout await you on the Gobblers Knob Trail. This route is an eastern approach to the lookout via Westside Road.",
      "Walk beneath stunning basalt and andesite cliffs along a beautiful creek with\twildflowers in the spring, stunning color in the fall and a side trip for a glass of wine and snacks."

      "The Icicle Gorge Trail, one of the most popular trails in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, is a wonderful way to explore the natural beauty of the Icicle Creek Valley. The interpretive loop trail has a gentle grade and scenic views of Icicle Creek, Icicle Gorge, and the surrounding forest that are ideal for families, trail runners, beginner hikers, bird enthusiasts, and those looking to take a nice long walk on a well-defined path.",
      "These quiet little lakes tucked on the south side of Mount Townsend make a delightful respite from the hordes that are trucking up Townsend. And, like Townsend, there are several ways to access them.",
      "Who doesn’t love a secret passageway? While the hordes gain Townsend from Quilcene side, sneak up on them from behind, then continue to Silver Lake for lovely camping and wandering opportunities.",
      "",
      "Take this lung-busting trail up the north side of Mount Townsend, through coniferous forests offering cameo views to the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the north, opening onto views of the Dungeness and Graywolf watersheds to the west.",
      "Flat Creek is a short day hike out of the Flat Creek Campground on the old Stehekin Valley Road. However, to get to the Stehekin road is a day or more trip, so you'll need to plan more than one day for this trip.",
      "Once upon a time, the road in Stehekin extended all the way to Cottonwood Camp, more than ten miles further into the lush green valley. But strong river activity due to snowmelt and rain events washed the road out frequently, and for one final time in 2003. Now it's accessible by foot only, and many of the trails found along this route are some of your best chance for solitude in the state.",
      "An out and back hike just across the border from Oregon. Views of the Wallowas and wide-open alpine meadows make this a southeastern Washington must.",
      "Wildflowers and views of the Kettle River Valley reward hikers of this lightly-used trail not far from Rebublic. After climbing steeply up to the shoulder of Edds Mountain, you'll ramble ridge-tops until you run into the Kettle Crest Trail.",
      "If nature excites you, there's plenty here to be excited about. Cool forest, trickling creeks in deep ravines, and a beautiful new trail built by WTA volunteers await you here.",
      "This trail provides spectacular views of the north face of Mount Rainier from Suntop Peak. It is over 5300' and the views are unobstructed. This is a fantastic snowshoe trip or hike, and a real calorie burner in that you can climb 4000' in five miles to the top. The hike is much shorter and easier in the summer.",
      "The Hidden Lake trail is one of the crown jewels of hiking in Washington State. No other trail offers so much as Hidden Lake Lookout: forest, wildflowers, a true alpine environment of stark granite well above treeline, breathtaking summit views of the heart of North Cascades National Park, and a fire lookout with a sweeping history almost as big as the mountainous landscape it gazes over.",
      "Take in views of scenic waterfalls, fall foliage, and Bonanza Peak from the trail to Hart Lake. The trail is unique in that it begins at Holden Village, a Lutheran ministry only reachable via a combined ferry and bus trip.",
      "One of the best meadow-traversing, ridge-walking, view-granting trails in the Skykomish Valley, Johnson Ridge is also surprisingly one of the quieter trails in the region. Sure, it's a long gravel road to the trailhead. And yes, the trail has some steep ups and downs. But the tread is good and the vertical suffering short-lived. Culminating on a peak named Scorpion Mountain, the hike gives a panoramic payoff of jagged peaks and emerald ridges that will leave you momentarily paralyzed.",
      "This high trail in the Olympics contours along Grand Ridge and offers a spectacular view of Mount Olympus.",
      "There are few places where you start your hike at 7,000 feet without any effort. Spectacular views, a dizzying array of wildflowers and larch groves -- this hike is simply gorgeous and a pure Pasayten experience.",
      "Ranking among the supreme ridge-running, cloud-probing, peak-peering jaunts in all of the North Cascades, the trek to Grasshopper Pass will have you hopping with joy with its nonstop horizon-spanning views of jagged ridges and colossal summits. Best of all, this alpine rapture is achieved with minimal effort. The trail starts high and stays high. And with the trail's gentle ups and down, most hikers young and old, two and four legged will have no problem making the journey.",
      "Hiking the Boundary Trail is an adventure on many a hikers’ bucket list. The trail spans the width of the Pasayten Wilderness and is part of the much larger Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. The combination of stunning scenery and lack of crowds is one of the BT’s most enticing aspects especially in autumn, when colors are changing, temperatures are cooling and bugs are gone. A number of places along the trail are so special that you’ll have the images etched into your memory for years to come.",
      "Stunning section of the PCT. Starts high and stays high, going from Harts Pass to Windy Pass to Holman Pass.",
      "At the highest Sno-Park in the state, you find a nice loop route with suberb snowshoe opportunities.",
      "Climb, climb, climb through several stages of eastern forest to open wildflower filled alpine meadows and inspired views on this abandoned lookout peak.",
      "Wander woods reminiscent of eastern hardwood forest, filled with aspen, hemlock and birch along the largest natural lake in the Colville National Forest—plus enjoy one of the best western larch displays in Eastern Washington.",
      "This is a classic multi-day backpack ideal in larch season.",
      "A fairly well used climber's trail goes straight up, and up, and then up Mount Baring. The trail requires moderate navigational skills and possibly climbing equipment in bad weather.",
      "This hike is full of the best things the Columbia Gorge has to offer: easy access and parking, well-maintained trail, wildflowers galore, two waterfalls, and views to knock off your sweaty socks. It’s a long journey at about 7.5 miles, and steep in places, but nothing a healthy dog, child or senior citizen can’t do. You’ll meet all of these smiling folks on this hike during the peak seasons.",
      "Just behind the High Bridge Guard Station at the end of the road in Stehekin, a trail leads to a quiet little lake nestled in lush, vibrant forest. This trail is primarily used by hikers heading to the summit of McGregor Mountain, the most prominent peak towering over the Stehekin Valley, but Howard Lake is a nice destination in and of itself, if you don’t have the time or the desire to tackle the 16 mile roundtrip hike up McGregor.",
      "Enjoy this short day hike with views of Chewelah and the surrounding valley and mountains.",
      "Several hiking trails exist in the Lookout Mountain Forest Preserve, part of the Whatcom County Park system, including a 2.2-mile loop with a one mile viewpoint spur trail, a quick waterfall trail, and lower loop trail. Alternatively, head up and up to Lookout Mountain on an eight mile service road.",
      "Here's an unusual hike through a very mossy forest and along a narrow river canyon, past sites that were important in local history. A railroad once ran along the canyon, passing through small communities. Logging was done in the area, and lime once was produced from limestone here, in a kiln that still stands. The railroad and communities are gone now, and much has disappeared over the past eighty years. But a few artifacts still remain and can be seen near the trail.",
      "Rarely can hikers approach a climbers’ realm so easily, with minimal elevation gain, and enjoy beautiful views all along the way."

      "This gorgeous loop hike has it all: big views of Mounts Baker and Shuksan, as well as the North Cascades, alpine lakes for swimming, and well-maintained trail winding through meadows and heather. And with wildflowers in spring, blueberry bushes for trail-side snacking in late summer and blazing color in the fall, you can't pick a bad season to visit.",
      "Bring the family for this easy hike at Heather Meadows. Two sparkling alpine lakes, an abundance of wildflowers, an impressive mountainous backdrop and a year-round snowfield make this a hike that will please everybody. What's more, this trail gets a fraction of the foot traffic that the trails at Artist Point get in late summer.",
      "Table Mountain trail offers a variety of nice views, and opportunities to get away from the parking lot crowds at Artist Point. But heed the cautions before you set out.",
      "This spectacular, short trail gets lots of love - and abuse - during its short hiking season. Accessible for less than three months each year, hordes of hikers and tourists take to it as the snow finally begins to melt.",
      "Hike from the Artist Point parking area to the Heather Meadows Visitor Center and back. With 1,100 feet of elevation gain, you'll have a great thigh workout. Combine Wild Goose with many of the other short trails in the area to make a full day of exploration, or use the Wild Goose trail to access Swift Creek or Lake Ann.",
      "Popular with locals and overnight visitors alike, the Rainbow Loop is a short and sweet way to get a feel for the valley and its breathtaking scenery. Combine it with a bike ride and a bakery visit and you'll get the full Stehekin valley experience in one day.",
      "Cascading 312 feet from Rainbow Creek high above the Stehekin valley floor, Rainbow Falls is perhaps the most popular natural destination for day visitors to the Stehekin Valley. And now, thanks to efforts from the National Park Service trail crew, a short trail exists here, offering a modest amount of elevation gain for a new vantage point of the waterfall.",
      "If you’re overnighting in the Stehekin Valley and just want a riverside ramble to while away the hours, try the Stehekin River Trail. It’s an easy forested walk along the mighty Stehekin River on a side of the valley that few visitors get to see.",
      "Take a walk around the historic (and still operational) apple orchard in the Stehekin valley.",
      "The West Fork Agnes Creek trail used to head west from Fivemile Camp on the Pacific Crest Trail (also known here as the South Fork Agnes Creek Trail). The West Fork Agnes Creek trail is now all but vanished. Navigating it is a rough bushwhack along the West Fork of Agnes Creek, with no destination except the base of 8115-foot Agnes Mountain.",
      "Dock Butte boasts sweeping views of Mount Baker, Baker Lake, and several prominent peaks in the North Cascades and Olympic Peninsula. It is a great option for beginner hikers looking to up their hiking game as well as those looking for exceptional mountain views without the mileage and time commitment of a longer hike.",
      "Don't expect solitude here- this is perhaps the most heavily used trail on Tiger Mountain, and for good reason. Fortunately, there is plenty of room to share. This close-to-the-city wild land trail provides stunning views, great forestlands, and ample opportunities to see birds and critters. West Tiger- one of the sprawling mountain's four primary peaks (West, Middle, South and East)- is itself a tri-crowned peak. Numbered 1 through 3, the third of the West Tiger peaks offers the best views, despite being the lowest of the triplets.",
      "Enjoy a flat, sandy stroll to the mouth of Willapa Bay on the Long Beach Peninsula.",
      "Evans Creek Preserve features a WTA-built trail system in an ecologically diverse enclave. Wetlands, meadows, and hillside forest can be found in this 179-acre farmstead-turned-suburban nature preserve that will thrill both the hiker and the birdwatcher. Not only that, this gem has ADA-accessible trails and is reachable by public transportation.",
      "This pleasant trail offers an almost level walk to a grassy forested lake set in the rocky basin beneath Cutthroat Peak. This is an easy hike in an area of rugged, steep country and one of the few that are suitable for small children. It is an especially pretty hike in the fall when the larch are turning golden.",
      "Found on the outskirts of Port Angeles, the Peabody Creek Trail starts out from the Olympic National Park Visitors Center and follows Peabody Creek through a quiet wooded ravine for 2.8 miles. It’s an excellent short hike for visitors, locals, and trail runners alike.",
      "The Tacoma Nature Center is a 70 acre nature preserve which includes Snake Lake and its surrounding wetlands and forest. There are a little over three miles of trails.",
      "Follow in the footsteps of the intrepid Press Expedition while enjoying the natural beauty, local history and wildlife along the Olympic Peninsula’s Elwha River.",
      "Backpack on primitive trails to Dodger Point Camp in the heart of Olympic National Park for unparalleled views of high, snowy peaks towering above deep forested valleys.",
      "A nontechnical climb with good views of Merchant, Gunn, and Baring.",
      "Meander alongside Liberty Creek, staying close to the water, on a trail that provides a loop option to the traditional out-and-back to the Liberty Lake cedar grove.",
      "Enjoy an easy hike along a salmon-spawning stream in a lush emerald ravine. Twanoh is derived from the Skokomish people, meaning \"gathering place.\"Twanoh State Park protects 182 acres of prime Hood Canal real estate-a perfect place for hikers and wildlife to gather.",
      "This popular hike provides a range of alpine experiences in a short loop. Walk along a hillside above a small valley, pause at a viewpoint overlooking a lake, and stroll through grassy meadows with stunning views of Mount Rainier. In season enjoy an abundance of wildflowers or perhaps a handful of huckleberries.",
      "The way to Melakwa Lake is like two different trails: first a wide gentle trail through old growth forest beneath an elevated and noisy Interstate freeway. And second, a rocky steep trail that follows a waterfall and a precipitous gorge upstream to get to a pair of clear alpine lakes flanked by rocky peaks. Is it about the journey or the destination? You decide.",
      "Thanks to a partnership between Washington State Parks and the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community, Kukutali Preserve in Similk Bay near La Conner opened to the public on June 16, 2014. Believed to be the first park in the United States to be co-owned and managed by a tribe and another government, management of the area focuses on conservation and research, public education and limited recreational use, including hiking!",
      "One of several Blue Lakes in Washington State, this Blue Lake lies about four and a half miles south of Mount Baker and requires less than a mile of hiking to reach it. Its translucent blue-green colors peek out beneath the shadows of a sheer rock wall partially encircling the lake, a reward for conquering the somewhat eroded and rooty trail that leads to it. Families, anglers, and hikers looking to experience a pretty subalpine lake will enjoy this short, yet memorable hike.",
      "Floods in 2006 severely damaged the Glacier Basin trail, but after four years of work, WTA completed a new trail in Glacier Basin at Mount Rainier National Park in the summer of 2011. Since then, hikers of all stripes have had the pleasure of enjoying a brand-new route to one of the mountain's most iconic glaciers on an easy-to-hike trail.",
      "Just a short drive from Spokane, this easy-going river hike is perfect for beginners or kids. Keep your eyes out for the deer, bald eagles, bird, ducks, herons and turkeys that make this forest their home.",
      "A scramble to the summit of a peak near Alpental. Proper gear and expertise recommended.",
      "The Sunrise area of Mount Rainier National Park offers many fantastic views of The Mountain. But don’t neglect the other views. Scramble up Skyscraper Mountain to enjoy a full 360 degree view of numerous lofty peaks, verdant treeless parks, and river valleys far below."

      "Start and end a hike with two different, commanding views of the San Juans, Skagit River flats, Olympic Mountains, and Samish Bay. Traverse the heights of Blanchard Mountain, the grandest of the Chuckanuts, from the Samish Overlook to Oyster Dome, the rocky promontory on Blanchard’s western slope.",
      "Oyster Dome is a rocky promontory on the western slope of Blanchard Mountain, the grandest member of the Chuckanut Mountain range, an extension of the Cascades that rises directly from the ocean. The sheer cliffs of Oyster Dome offer year-round access to commanding views of the San Juans, Skagit River flats, Olympic Mountains, and Samish Bay.",
      "Welcome to the High Divide, an emerald carpet laden with dazzling bouquets draped over a rolling mile-high ridge. Only one problem with this invitation-delivering your reply will be downright demanding. The hike to Welcome Pass is a doozy: 2800 feet of elevation gain in 2.5 miles. And talk about switchbacks. There are more than sixty-count 'em! But once you make the grade, Welcome Pass extends a warm benvenuti and a sincere invite to poke around on the wide-open slopes of the divide, drinking fine views and savoring precious alpine moments.",
      "Follow a gentle old railroad grade into the coal-mining ghost town of Franklin, along the Green River near Black Diamond. It’s an easy walk up to the coal cart and sealed mine shaft. Follow the narrow footpath beyond to discover the powerhouse foundation and cemetery.",
      "Stand in awe watching the swift-moving waters of the North Fork Skokomish River barrel and thunder over a series of cascades. A great hike anytime of year, Staircase Rapids is especially impressive during the spring runoff. Hikers of all ages will be delighted on this easy and captivating hike.",
      "Enjoy lakeside views and the surrounding hills plus waterfalls and giant old Douglas Fir trees from an old railroad grade of the Bellingham & Eastern Railway that borders the southeast shore of Lake Whatcom.",
      "Perfect for a winter leg-stretcher or a spring woodland flower hike, this easy trail will appeal to most hikers, young and old. Through groves of old-growth conifers, over cascading creeks, and hugging the lush banks of the Gray Wolf River, the trail marches up a quiet canyon in the Buckhorn Wilderness. Plenty of good picnic sites, too, can be found along the tumbling, churning river. And there's always an excellent chance of spotting a big critter along the way.",
      "Find supreme wildflower gardens and a high-country plateau speckled with shimmering tarns-but that's not all. Spectacular alpine vistas abound too-of Baker, Shuksan, and all those rugged and craggy peaks straddling the 49th parallel. Yellow Aster Butte may be a misnomer (those yellow-petaled delights are actually daisies), but you definitely don't want to miss hiking here.",
      "Navaho Pass is an excellent introduction to the Teanaway area. Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for.",
      "From Navaho Pass, the trail to Navaho Peak is siren-like, pulling you towards the summit long after you realize how tired you are. But for peak-baggers, or those simply interested in getting a gorgeous view from a relatively easy-to-navigate peak, the views are worth the extra effort.",
      "Mowich Lake is a moderate snowshoe tucked into the northwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park.",
      "This wooded walk enters a lush ravine lined with remnant old-growth and gives way to an isolated beach with views of Protection Island.",
      "For a nice location in the Central Cascades, try the Iron Horse-John Wayne Trail along the western shore of Lake Keechelus. This is a treat for new snowshoers, especially if it has been recently groomed. Because of its easy accessibility, it can often get crowded on nicer days.",
      "A popular summertime destination for many hikers and backpackers, Lake Valhalla also makes a rewarding advanced snowshoe route.",
      "Each year, from fall to spring, this area is a bird paradise, with snow geese and trumpeter and tundra swans overwintering in huge numbers. There are several access points in the wildlife refuge. The Headquarters area has a 2-mile trail and staff may be able to point you to other appropriate areas to visit.",
      "Mazama Ridge at Mount Rainier's Paradise area offers an especially scenic intermediate-level snowshoe route in the midst of snow-covered alpine meadows.",
      "Visit the high point in Fields Spring State Park, tucked in the extreme southeast corner of Washington state. At the summit of Puffer Butte, you'll be rewarded with grand views for very little sweat equity. Used primarily in the winter months, the park is a quiet place for locals and visitors to explore year round, whether hiking, cross-country skiing, or snowshoeing.",
      "For a more strenuous snowshoe, head out to Deer Creek and the Lake Kelcema trail. From the parking area, the route proceeds up Deer Creek Road (Road 4052). Watch out for tubers and sledders on the lower portion.",
      "This popular summer trail offers wildflower-filled meadows, a glistening alpine lake, big mountain views and wildlife sighting aplenty.",
      "If you'd like nose-to-nose access to Mount Baker, this first-rate woodsy walk delivers. Over a relatively short, well-maintained trail with mild elevation gain, you can be glacier-side in no time... if the creek crossings allow.",
      "The Greg Ball Trail is a trail envisioned by and honoring one of the greatest trail advocates this state has ever had. Ball was a former board member and director of the WTA. In 1993 he launched the organization’s volunteer trail maintenance program which has since grown into the largest state-based program of its kind. He designed this trail to Wallace Lake and it was finished in his memory by volunteers from WTA and through support from the Spring Trail Trust.",
      "Bearhead Mountain is a moderate, well-marked trail through the forest that carries you to an old fire lookout site with a bold and brassy Rainier view.",
      "The eastern part of the Grand Ridge trail can be accessed from Deer Park as a day hike and has a charm all of its own -- forest with avalanche lilies in spring, wildflower meadows and great views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, the Cascades, and the Olympic mountains.",
      "Take a hike on the edge of Spokane Valley with commanding views of Spokane Valley and the Palouse. On the way, you'll see many plant species typical of western slopes of Cascades, a seasonal stream, and amazing variety of wildflowers through from late March through mid-July.",
      "A hefty workout, spectacular views, and very little company await you on this summit.",
      "There's no question why Ingalls Lake is one of the most popular destinations in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. It is a stunning blue lake, set high in a basin beneath rocky peaks, showcasing striking Mount Stuart as its backdrop. The trail to this treasure is filled with delights, both for the summer adventurer as well as for those hikers who appreciate fall colors. Views of the craggy Esmeralda Peaks, a walk through beautiful Headlight Basin plus a pretty picture of the imposing Stuart Range are just a few of the wonders along the way.",
      "Jutting 800 feet out of Banks Lake in Washington’s majestic coulee country, Steamboat Rock is the crown jewel of this area. The basalt butte has a rich history; first used by native people many years ago, and during the ice age, the Great Missoula Floods carved the canyons here, while the rock stood as an island in the raging river. Now, with the Columbia rolling out in its original course, Steamboat Rock lies high and dry, offering excellent 360-degree panoramas of the landscape surrounding it.",
      "The Skyline Divide is a 6000-foot-high ridgeline extension of Mount Baker that transforms itself into a summertime paradise of unrivaled mountain views and unending wildflower fields, a trail that deposits you just 3.5 miles from the summit itself.",
      "Bare Mountain, the site of a former fire lookout, is a superb viewpoint with mountains in every direction and lakes close by. In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.",
      "A nice trip through a quiet forest that features trees, moss, and ferns on a steep hillside above a babbling creek."

      "There are two sides to Bandera Mountain – gentle and well groomed on the one hand, rough and untamed on the other. Together, they make for a very satisfying hike along a rocky ridge to a false summit (Little Bandera) with views impressive enough to dissuade most from completing the final half mile of informal trail to the “real” summit.",
      "If you're looking for a quick way to get away from the car and into Mount Rainier's alpine splendor, this is your express lane to ecstasy. The Sourdough Ridge Trail, which begins in the thick of the tourist-choked Sunrise visitor center, leaves it all fairly quickly, climbing to a ridge top and turning east beneath Antler Peak. Kids love the open views and general abundance of marmots.",
      "The two-story frame cabin of Mount Fremont, built in 1934, provides an opportunity to reminisce about the time when watchmen stood guard over the forest, with an eye out for wildfires.",
      "These two little larch-fringed lakes tucked within the basaltic slopes of Mission Ridge make an ideal destination year-round. Clara and Marion offer excellent spring hiking, good heat relief in the summer, a spectacular color show in autumn, and a wonderful family-friendly snowshoeing route in winter. These are the only motor-free trails along Mission Ridge-savor this area's peace along with its beauty.",

      "This hike is a flat 3.3 mile one way blacktop trail that starts at The Port of Anacortes and ends at March Point near The Shell and Tesoro Refineries. The trail has great views of Mount Baker, Fidalgo Bay and lots of blue heron, especially when the tides are low.",

      "Ridge-top meadows stretching for miles await you here, though you'll work to reap those rewards. The trail climbs steeply from the low valley bottom to the high ridgeline, but once aloft on those airy plains, you'll stroll through endless fields of flowers, basking in the glorious views of the South Cascades peaks, from the mammoth volcanoes-Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and even Oregon's Mount Hood-to the modest little knobs and knolls that make up the heart of the range-Juniper Peak, Jumbo Peak, Sunrise, Dark Mountain, etc.",

With towering granite peaks, forests, meadows, wildflowers, and of course the beautiful mountain lake surrounded by granite that reaches for the sky, this short hike is easily a classic and should be on your must-hike list. With only 1050 feet of elevation gain this hike is doable for almost everyone. If you’re driving over Highway 20 and don’t have all day, stop for this mountain gem.",
      "Tucked in a high cirque surrounded by sky-piercing peaks, the Crater Lakes epitomize rugged beauty. Among the most accessible of the alpine gems lacing jagged Sawtooth Ridge, reaching the Craters still exacts a fair amount of sweat and grit. But, while many of the nearby lakes often swirl in activity, Craters' environs generally remain calm. Hikers are few, horses rare, motorcycles barred. Come here in October when golden larches light up the steep valley walls and you'll swear you found the pearly gates.",
      "Hike to a pair of splendid lakes nestled high on the Sawtooth Ridge. Lower Eagle is perched in a peaceful grove of pines, while Upper Eagle sits in a lofty cirque flanked by spiraling crags and ribbons of larch. It travels through big ponderosa and sweet-scented sage to glistening granite ledges, granting extensive views of nearby rock and distant hazy hills. Hot in the height of summer, this hike is a delight in early season when patches of snow prohibit wheels, or in early autumn when cool air blows down from the passes and the majestic larches turn the Eagles golden.",

      "Hidden in a high cirque in the hinterlands of Hoodoo Peak, Libby Lake is one of the loneliest and loftiest in the Sawtooth Range. And floating at an elevation of 7618 feet, it's also one of the highest alpine lakes in the entire Cascades. Surrounded by towering walls and tailings of talus, Libby's setting is stark. But its outlet is graced with rows of stately larches. In summer their delicate needles add soft green streaks to the barren basin, while in autumn their golden transformation adds light. It's a stiff climb, best attempted early to beat the Okanogan sun.",
      "Ditch the North Bend crowds by heading six miles farther east to Mount Washington. This easy-access day hike delivers comparable—if not superior—panoramic views and lung-busting switchbacks to Mount Si, with significantly less foot traffic.",
      "Explore an easy, gently graded trail to Falls Creek Falls just outside of Winthrop. The first waterfall is just a quarter-mile from the trailhead and is accessible via a paved trail.",
      "Hike to a heathered high divide at the headwaters of the Twisp River. Following an old prospector's path first through lush forest then across sun-kissed slopes flush in floral splendor, the way isn't easy but it has its rewards. From the lofty pass enjoy up-close and personal views of some of the North Cascades more distinguished peaks. To the north Liberty Bell Mountain rings out, while Stiletto Peak sticks out like a knife in the south. Visit in fall and watch Copper turn to gold thanks to the larches.",
      "Glorious in autumn when golden larches set the hills aglow and crimson blue-berry bushes light the meadows on fire, this dramatic portal into the North Cascades National Park makes a fine summer destination as well. During those warmer months enjoy alpine floral displays with glacier lilies, phlox, lupine, and paintbrush stealing the show. And while Twisp Pass in itself is a worthy objective, consider pushing farther. Drop down to Dagger Lake or wander a couple of miles of spectacular, open high country to explore polished granite shelves, remote grassy benches, and quiet hidden tarns.",
      "Experience the variety offered by the North Cascades: high mountain ridges with spectacular views, a remote river valley, and even a self-propelled cable car river crossing. Popular side trips include Hannegan Peak and Whatcom Pass.",
      "Eagle Lake is a shallow and infrequently visited alpine lake in the shadows of Merchant Peak and Townsend Mountain in the Stevens Pass region. Walk this trail to experience a variety of mountain terrain and wildlife encompassed by few other hikes.",
      "Where can you find unobstructed views of Mount Rainier and the mountains of Snoqualmie Pass, see rare butterfly species, and go berry-picking, all in return for a modest 1330-foot elevation gain? Mount Catherine, of course! This off-the-beaten-path hike to the summit of a wintertime ski destination is one of the most rewarding climbs along the southern wall of Snoqualmie Pass.",
      "The Enchantment Lakes are an alpine wonderland of pristine lakes set among polished granite, soaring peaks, blazing larches, and ambling mountain goats. Widely regarded as the crown jewel of hiking in Washington, this trail exceeds even the wildest of superlatives.",
      "An accessible hike for seasoned veterans and neophytes alike, Wallace Falls provides visitors with breathtaking views of the Wallace River and the surrounding falls on a relatively low difficulty, scenic 5.6 mile round-trip. Although well attended and often busy, the trail stands as a true showcase of the diversity and majestic beauty that the Central Cascades can offer to hikers who journey into the heart of this sublime mountain range.",
      "Crossing through the stunning Alpine Lakes wilderness, this section is a must-do for serious Washington backpackers. This 75-mile section leads through some of the most beautiful, remote and diverse surroundings along the PCT.",
      "At 5605 feet of elevation, Silver Peak is the tallest mountain guarding the southern wall of Snoqualmie Pass. Silver Peak has more than 2000 feet of prominence and provides commanding, panoramic views of the eastern end of Snoqualmie Pass and the surrounding mountains and lakes.",
      "In a state with so many places offering a day's walk to big, peaky views, Green Mountain still makes the short-list of Washington's all-time finest hikes. From woods to meadows to panoramic views and even a historic lookout, it just doesn't get much better than this.",
      "A tough route through spectacular scenery.",
      "This long but easy valley romp follows boisterous Phelps Creek to a mile-long broad flower-bursting meadow and a giant cirque beneath a formidable wall of towering peaks. But don't expect solitude, for Spider Meadow crawls with backpackers-brigades of them! The valley is large enough to disperse in, though, and Phelps Basin offers a quiet retreat from the meadow's loungers and shutterbugs and their tent cities.",
      "Follow tumbling, churning, Van Trump Creek upstream past spectacular Bloucher Falls and Comet Falls, to an alpine meadow featuring views of Mount Rainier and easy wandering. For an added treat, hike two extra miles for a stunning view of the barren Kautz Creek valley from Mildred Point.",
      "Topping out at 5685 feet, High Rock is dramatically higher than its surroundings. On a clear day, the exposed summit provides outstanding views all around and down. The trail is moderately steep but short, following Sawtooth Ridge 1.6 miles to the summit, where a fire lookout cabin clings to the top.",
      "Liberty, originally named Meaghersville, is a living ghost town. It was the center of a Washington State gold rush in the 1870s and has the look and feel often associated with the term ghost town. There is no formal trail through Liberty, but the open landscape makes it easy to navigate. Since it begins by the roadside, it’s a perfect exploration for all ages and abilities.",
      "Once the center of mining activity in Yakima County, Copper City served 42 active mining claims from 1907 to 1942. The founders of the town hoped to boom when the railroad came through, but the tracks were never put down. Walk the old mine-to-market road into town, where only the collapsed remains of a few buildings remain.",
      "Once the largest hospital for mentally ill people in Washington State, Northern State Mental Hospital was a town unto itself. Parts of the site are still in use and off-limits, but the farm is now a recreation area. It is located just north of the Skagit River near the town of Sedro-Woolley. Stroll along the wide pastoral trails amongst the buildings and cemetery.",
      "The ghost town of Bordeaux sits on Mima Creek, south of Olympia. It was one of the longest-lived logging company towns in the Northwest. Walk into the tall grass and cross the creek on a narrow wooden bridge to get into town. Head right to find the still-standing building.",
      "Follow a gentle path along the eastern portion of the Iron Goat Trail near Stevens Pass, once the original path of the Great Northern Railway. Visit the townsite of Wellington (later named Tye) known for the first Cascade Tunnel and as the site of one of the worst natural disasters in US history.",
      "Hike a gentle gravel road along the upper reaches of the Green River near Stampede Pass to find the ghost town of Lester, once an important stop along the Northern Pacific Railroad. Walk the gravel road into town, where 2 wooden buildings still stand on the south side of the railroad tracks. Venture farther up the road and north through the woods to find several more structures.",
      "This is the perfect outing for families, or for anyone wanting an easy day in the glorious wildflower fields of the Sunrise area. Indeed, if you have out-of-town guests you want to impress, this gentle mountain stroll will have them thinking you live in heaven on earth. This little loop explores wonderful alpine meadows and provides glorious views of Mount Rainier, with very little elevation gain.",
      "A scramble up a peak near Snow Lake. Climbing gear and experience required.",
      "Take a hike within sight and sound of the wild Sauk River--part of the Skagit Wild and Scenic River System established to maintain the free flowing nature of Washington's rivers. You'll wander through a forest of moss-covered maple, cedar and fir, listening for wildlife and the sound of the river.",
      "Gem Lake is nestled at the foot of Wright Mountain and is about two miles beyond the trail junction at Rock Creek trail #1013.1 that intersects with the Snow Lake trail starting at Alpental. Beautiful colors surround the lake in autumn as do the many climbable peaks in the area.",
      "Hike downhill, enjoy spring blooms and throw rocks into a punchbowl at the bottom of a 40-foot waterfall.",
      "Climb to a big, beautiful sparkling lake cupped in a cirque high on the craggy Chiwawa Ridge. Silver logs line the shoreline and shine in the afternoon sun. Asters and gentians add strokes of indigo and violet to the surrounding meadows. In autumn, low-lying blueberry bushes set the basin afire in crimson. While the climb can be stiff, the toughest part of this hike may be right in the beginning. If the Chiwawa River can't be safely forded, head to nearby Estes Butte or Basalt Peak instead, returning to Schaefer when river levels have subsided.",
      "Dry, hot, and dusty in high summer, Estes Butte makes a good choice in June or autumn. Its southern sun-baked slopes allow for early season sauntering when surrounding summits in the Entiats and on Chiwawa Ridge are shrouded in snow. Views of those jagged peaks from this old lookout site are good, and so is the one down to the broad glacier-carved valley below."

      "The good news is you'll have unmatched views nearly every step along this trail. Grand vistas to the north, east, south, and west await you here, so even if you can hear the tourist traffic on its way to and from Sunrise, you'll still have a great adventure--and you'll find your camera full of some of the best pictures of Mount Rainier you'll ever get.",
      "Hike a re-built trail adjacent to the Wild Sky Wilderness. The Beckler Peak trail opened in September of 2011, and with it, the Jennifer Dunn trailhead. The trail takes you through an old-growth forest to summit views of Glacier Peak, Baring, Index, the Monte Cristo Range, and Evergreen Mountain. It's easy to get to and provides great rewards for your effort. The trail has a gentle grade, it is well built, and suitable for kids. Be sure to take water with you, because there is no reliable water along the trail.",
      "Take a short but steep hike on a wide trail to visit two lakes in a beautiful craggy setting. It's only three miles to the upper lake, with 2,600 feet of elevation gain. In season find many wildflowers in the basin near the upper lake, and be alert for wildlife sightings.",
      "Great day hike through old growth with the final 1000 feet on the west slope rock of Red Mountain. When dry, this roughly 40 degree incline is mostly a walk-up with hands needed here and there. Amazing 360 degree view from the summit.",
      "With a moderate grade on a wide trail, the hike to Talapus Lake is the perfect introduction to the outdoors for hikers and beginning backpackers. Upon arrival at Talapus, break out lunch or pitch camp. Either way, you can cool off in the large lake. If you feel like pressing on, Ollalie Lake is just about a mile and a half up trail, where open campsites offer lakeside havens with calm waters and views of a beautiful lake basin.",
      "Hike to the northwesternmost point in the continental United States. Here, where the Strait of Juan de Fuca meets the Pacific, Cape Flattery protrudes into a sea of tumultuous waters. A land of dramatic headlands, sea stacks, and deep narrow coves, Cape Flattery exhibits sheer rugged beauty. Scores of seabirds ride the surf and scavenge the sea stacks. Watch for whales and sea lions too. And the sunsets... they're simply divine.",
      "Enjoy up-close, breathtaking views of Mount Shuksan’s west face, along with views of Fisher Chimney, the upper and lower Curtiss Glacier, as well as Mount Baker from the trail to Lake Ann. The lake in a rocky basin, in the midst of this spectacular scenery. On some days you can hear ice echoing through the valley as it crashes down the face of Mount Shuksan. This is a late season hike, as snow can linger here into August.",
      "This trail takes you to the 49th parallel. The real hike of this State Park is the tour of Gardner Cave. This cave is the 3rd longest limestone cave in Washington.",
      "Hike a series of short, nearly level trails that offer views of two lakes and of some swampy areas, and pass one of the largest trees in the Tigers. Appreciate the forest vegetation and wildflowers. Along the way, hear and perhaps see a variety of song birds and waterfowl.",
      "A couple miles beyond Lake Stuart and a few hundred feet up lies Horseshoe Lake--a stunning, silent lake that makes for an excellent day trip for those lucky folks who get to camp at Lake Stuart. It’s also attainable as a day hike, but you’ll want to get an early start.",
      "Follow the Diablo Lake Trail up and across talus slopes on the flanks of Sourdough Mountain to impressive cascading waterfalls and stunning views of Ross Lake and Colonial, Pyramid, Davis Peaks, as well as Jack Mountain.",
      "Barclay Lake offers something for almost everyone: a well-maintained trail that is accessible to beginners and children, stunning mountain views, mycology, camping, a serene alpine lake, and a staging area for challenging adventures in the 106,000-acre Wild Sky Wilderness. Keep your camera charged, as this popular pathway in the shadow of Baring Mountain offers many photo opportunities.",
      "Two miles past Barclay Lake is Eagle Lake. The trail is unmarked but pretty clear and the way is steep.",
      "The Milk Creek trail is one of the primary trails to enter the wonders of the Glacier Peak Wilderness and offers a terrific 34.7-mile backpacking loop. Along the way it offers stunning close up views of Glacier Peak, endless wildflower meadows and ample opportunities for solitude.",
      "Begin in old-growth forest, climb up to one of Mount Rainier's most spectacular wildflower meadows, then continue along the highest section of the Wonderland Trail to reach the alpine world of Panhandle Gap. Along the way be alert for marmots and goats, and it is not unusual to see a black bear.",
      "Burroughs Mountain can be described as a 'mountain against a mountain'. At over 7800 feet, Burroughs Mountain sets right up against the northeastern face of Mount Rainier, hugging the Winthrop Glacier. It offers one of the most dramatic views of the massive volcano.",
      "Enter rarefied air as you climb halfway up the most popular route to the summit of Mount Rainier. This is Camp Muir, a perch higher than the summits of nearly all mountains in the state. In addition to commanding views of the South Cascades, catch a glimpse of both the history of the park and the dramatic landscape of Rainier’s upper reaches.",
      "This short trail crosses the Inter Fork of the White River to views of The Mountain's largest glacier and the valley carved by this river of ice.",
      "This short hike to a sparkling, tree-ringed lake makes an ideal day hike, family outing or introductory backpacking weekend.",
      "This trail features plenty of variety, with destinations spaced perfectly for families or first-time backpackers. Beautiful hemlock forest, meadows dotted with wildflowers, gleaming lakes, mountain views, juicy berries and excellent camping are all available. Wait until later in the hiking season though, as this area is known for its bugs.",
      "Do this hike not for the destination, but for the journey. \"Lake\" is an overstatement. Pond, maybe, but Pyramid Puddle is more like it. Still, this easily accessible trail gets a fair amount of traffic, as it makes for a good spring conditioner or late-fall snow prober. And while Pyramid Lake is tiny, some of the trees along the way are anything but small. The real allure of this trail is the impressive old-growth forest it traverses, compensating for any lake letdown",
      "",
      "Consider Ruby Beach to be Olympic wilderness coast lite. You'll get the same great wilderness taste as Cape Alava, Shi Shi Beach, and Third Beach, but for a lot less calories. The hike to Ruby Beach is a mere 0.25 mile, but it's a glorious 0.25 mile. Through a wind-blasted maritime forest, follow a well-groomed trail lined with salt-sprayed shrubs to the mighty Pacific. Emerge behind a barrier of surf-tossed logs and consider your options: south to Beach 6 or 3 lonely miles north to the mouth of the Hoh River",
      "This stunning Olympic coastal hike is one of the more photographed places in Washington for good reason.",
      "A beautiful granite basin housing two sparkling lakes and big views. Explorations abound with nearly a dozen lakes to look down upon or explore around.",
      "The trail up to Winchester Mountain is less than two miles long and only 1300 feet of elevation gain, with access to a lookout at 6500 feet with outstanding 360 degree views. What’s the catch? The road.",

      "With spectacular groves of old-growth forest, meadows teeming with wildlife, and views of rugged surrounding peaks, the West Fork Humptulips River bottom is one of the most varied of the rainforest valleys. Devoid of visitors and traversing the edge of one of the largest roadless areas in the Olympic National Forest, this hike offers a true wilderness experience. The river must be forded eight times, but if amphibious adventuring is not for you, 1.5 miles of dry trail (and kid-friendly hiking) can be enjoyed year-round from the northern terminus of this hike at the Campbell Tree Grove.",
      "Big trees, a wilderness valley flourishing with wildlife, and no crowds. The peninsula's wildest rainforest valleys are up the Queets River, and many a hiker has never ventured into this enchanting corner of Olympic National Park. The main deterrent is accessibility, both to and on the trail. The gravel 14-mile Queets River Road can often be agonizing to drive. And once you reach the trailhead, you'll find there's no bridge over the river! This keeps more than a handful of adventurers from ambling up the trail. But if you persist you're guaranteed a lonesome journey.",
      "The Sol Duc River may be a happening place with its hot springs resort, riverside campgrounds, and miles of popular trails, but not so for the North Fork. Here you're likely to run into only elk and deer. Is the trail rough? Hardly. It's one of the most enjoyable riverside trails on the peninsula. It's just that it really doesn't go anywhere-no peak, no lake. And in today's goal-oriented society, these types of trails are overlooked. But if it's miles of solitude you're seeking, and peace of mind that only wilderness can instill, this is your trail.",
      "Hike to a former fire lookout site on the Olympic Peninsula. Fires are now patrolled by aircraft here, but the beautiful, rugged surroundings can still be reviewed by hikers from the lookout with a name that draws on a Chinook phrase that translates to \"stand guard\".",
      "Tunnel Creek Trail has two trailheads. Nearly all hikers access the trail from the north side where for the first three miles the moderately easy grade is often within earshot of Tunnel Creek. After crossing the South Fork of Tunnel Creek, the route rises at a steeper but manageable grade past Harrison Lakes to 5050 Pass and some nearby viewpoints. The south side trailhead is on the Dosewallips Road. This segment’s notoriously steep grade to 5050 Pass means it is seldom used. Try it and you’ll find out why.",
      "Thick old-growth forest of Douglas-fir and hemlock line the lower trail, while ridgetop meadows and clear alpine vistas await you on the upper trail. The path climbs steeply and steadily, giving you a good workout. But the payoff for that work includes glorious views of Mount Rainier and the Goat Rocks Peaks, as well as the many rocky summits of the Tatoosh Range.",
      "This is one of the best day hikes for larch-spotting in the fall. In the summer, enjoy the reward of swimming or fishing after a steep climb. Scatter Lake is also an excellent destination for an overnight backpack.",
      "A pale green creek, big old trees, a variety of understory, and peek-a-boo views of snow-capped peaks. Day-hikers should take it easy, as the joy here is in the journey not the destination. Backpackers, however, may disagree. Families and first-time backpackers will enjoy beautiful camps just two miles from the trailhead. Experienced backpackers will note that Thunder Creek is a gateway to an extensive network of trails.",
      "Imagine that you are looking through a telephoto lens at one of those iconic images of Mount Rainier taken from the south. Now zoom out to a wider view of the entire mountain, the thick forests below timberline, the enormous brown gash of the Nisqually River Valley, and beside it the verdant parkland that became known as Paradise. This is the view from the Pinnacle Saddle trail.",
      "The open meadows above Paradise draw hikers from around the world. Countless opportunities for enjoying these flowers can be found in the maze of meadow trails, but heading up toward Panorama Point and beyond on the Glacier Vista Loop is the best of the bunch.",
      "If you want the best possible views with the shortest hiking dis-tance, this trail is for you. Few 5-mile hikes offer the quality of views you'll find here.",
      "Steep is the name of Starway's game. You'll reach the summit in just 1.5 miles, but it's a grueling 3000 feet of elevation to get there. Along the way, the trail (which is hard to find at times) is littered with wildflowers in the spring and huckleberries in the fall. Once you arrive at the top, enjoy a 360-degree view that includes Mounts Adams, St. Helens, Hood, Jefferson, and Rainier, as well as nearby Silver Star Mountain. On particularly clear days, you may even see the peaks of the Oregon Coast Range.",
      "Tucked in a cirque a few miles east of Stevens Pass are Minotaur Lake, its immediate neighbor Theseus and overlooking Labyrinth Mountain. This group of alpine destinations, named for symbols in the Greek mythos, make for a great day hike and an excellent workout.",
      "Enjoy an easy 1.2-mile loop near the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center. Pair it with the Hall of Mosses for a couple of nice, flat exploratory leg-stretchers in the Hoh. Both make for an interesting introduction to the area, and will be a hit with the kids!",
      "Hiking across bare talus slopes, past rocky outcrops and fields of wildflowers while admiring sweeping vistas you would think you're at 7,000 feet. But the alpine-like setting at this mid-elevation is the result of period of wildfires that swept the area in the early 1900's.",
      "The Kettle Crest South begins at the White Mountain Trailhead and extends to Sherman Pass, passing by White Mountain, Barnaby Butte, Bald Mountain, Snow Peak, and Sherman Peak along the way.",
      "Exploring a verdant canyon on the east side of the Kettle Range, Hoodoo Trail makes a great early-season conditioning hike or introduction to overnighting. The hike up Hoodoo Canyon from Trout Lake to Emerald Lake is a classic, low-elevation Inland Northwest hike through one of the largest remaining low-elevation roadless areas in the Kettle Range.",
      "A boat ride up Lake Chelan to a summer camp, then a long hike to beautiful remote lakes east of Glacier Peak.",
      "The short route to Meeks Table goes through some forest then begins a moderately steep and short climb to a ridgeline, eventually continuing along the ridge, where you will walk through a myriad of wildflowers.",
      "This is a scenic, easy to moderate hike or snowshoe up a broad canyon with a good chance of spotting bands of elk.",
      "Rich in historical artifacts, lush foliage, wooden bridges, and waterfalls, the well-groomed and well-traveled Coal Creek Trail is a satisfying hike for families, trail runners, history buffs, and avid hikers.",
      "This is a nice, short hike to a recently repaired fire lookout. Guidebooks do not include recent upgrades to the trail and road to the trailhead. The trail is no longer only accessible via a scramble, but trail that switchbacks through wildflowers and interesting rock walls which was constructed in 2007. The lookout itself has been repaired, making it a nice lunch stop.",
      "This is a pleasant hike to a small lake and a notched gap with sweeping views. Sheep Lake is nestled in a subalpine area that explodes with wildflowers in July and August. The lake is a good place to relax and enjoy nature or perhaps take off your boots and go wading. Sourdough Gap is a small saddle in a rocky-edged ridge. The hike from the lake to the gap offers increasingly picturesque views of the south Cascades with every foot of altitude you gain. Once at the gap, you will be rewarded with grand views of Sheep Lake on one side and the Crystal Lakes basin on the other side.",
      "The hike to big, beautiful Boardman Lake is one of the easiest off of the Mountain Loop Highway. Just under a mile and gaining a mere 250 feet of elevation along the way (and 50 on the way back), this lovely backcountry body of water can be reached by just about every hiker-young and old, long-legged and short-breathed, and everyone else in between.",
      "Gold Creek Pond is an ADA-accessible paved loop hike around a picturesque mountain pond atop Snoqualmie Pass.",
      "Nestled in a quiet basin only a stone’s throw from Snoqualmie Pass, pristine Mirror Lake is a destination to be enjoyed by the whole family. Rarely can you find such lovely sites with so little effort, but here, a short trek will take you through forests, across delicate streams, and past brightly colored wildflowers. Humming with butterflies, birds, bees, and babbling streams, this trail is not to be missed.",
      "Check the weather before heading out for this hike, and if it’s going to be clear, bring a camera. From the summit, it’s possible to see six (yes, six!) volcanoes spanning two states. Baker, Glacier, Adams, Rainier, St. Helens and Hood wait patiently for you to climb the more-than-moderately steep path to the summit of Crystal Peak, where you can take in beautiful snow-capped majesty from the top.",
      "The trail around Wynoochee Lake is a pleasant stroll through second growth forest with a lush understory. As with many “lakeshore” trails, the trail is not actually near the lakeshore. While the lake is generally out of sight, it does allow the possibility of a hike/canoe biathlon, if you can find a partner with a canoe. Wynoochee Lake is smaller and calmer than some of the lakes in Washington, making this a nice option.",
      "Ever wanted to hike the Wonderland Trail, but have time for only a sneak peek? Here’s how to enjoy a sampling of the Wonderland’s spectacular scenery—in a single day!",
      "Hike a beautiful, flat 2.5 mile walk in the woods along the White Chuck River. The trail has been cleared its entire length thanks to WTA trail crews."

      "Visit any of several beautiful alpine lakes, in rocky basins. The day can be as easy as a 3.6 roundtrip hike to Trout Lake, or as strenuous as the nearly 15-mile hike to Big Heart Lake as you like. Good options exist both for day-hikers and for backpackers.",
      "The Volcano View Trail completes a trifecta of great hikes for children near Mount St. Helens. The nearby Ape Cave and the Trail of Two Forests both provide welcome respite from the typically hot and dry hikes around St. Helens. The Ape Caves weave underground through old lava tubes, while the Trail of Two Forests shows the volcano's power, contrasting old-growth forest with the devastated landscape that didn't escape the 1980 explosion. Now the new Volcano View Trail offers hikers of every age a mile-long nature trail that curves around stumps, boulders and hemlocks.",
      "Marmot Pass offers great views and a gentle hike through old-growth forest as well as high meadows. It is a great day hike, but also offers a great starting place for a variety of overnight options.",
      "This trail climbs from the trailhead on Forest Road 5401 through an old-growth forest to views of the many mountains of the South Cascades from Observation Peak.",
      "The Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT) is to Tiger Mountain what the Pacific Crest Trail is to the Cascades--a long, winding trail that crosses many summits and offers a long thru hike or short section hikes. This is the shortest, but possibly most scenic, of the main TMT sections. It's an outstanding introduction to Tiger Mountain and its wonderful wildland trails.",
      "This short, family-friendly trail with numerous add-on options visits a pretty lake basin at the easternmost edge of the North Cascades and provides long-distance views of some of Washington's loneliest country.",
      "Taylor Mountain represents an experiment in forest management. Over the decades, loggers took what they could from the 1700-acre forest, leaving behind a mess of scrub brush and second- (and third-) growth trees. But that young forest has filled in nicely and nature is once more proving that, given the chance, it can recover on its own.",
      "Wedged between craggy Thunder and Spark Plug mountains, these two lakes are set in a truly electrifying environment, flanked by towering evergreens and slopes of shiny granite ledges and talus. But even more stimulating than these aquatic gems is the forest that lines the trail leading to them. It's one of the finest tracts of old growth along the US 2 corridor.",
      "Explore this wonderful example of low-elevation old-growth forest. In addition to wandering among the trees, you will find small waterfalls, vibrant wetlands and quiet ponds.",
      "Explore this 600-acre urban forest on a network of wellsigned trails, just 30 minutes from Seattle.",
      "This is a classic Olympics river hike without the crowds, and it's downhill all the way to your destination.",
      "A 110-acre Skagit County Park with the largest remaining undeveloped waterfront on Fidalgo Island near Anacortes. Highlights include a freshwater beaver pond and the stunning views of Rosario Strait.",
      "Venture up a valley as wild as any in the adjacent national park. Marvel at the sheer height, girth, and biomass of some of the biggest trees you'll ever lay eyes on. Watch in awe as the churning, tumbling Upper South Fork Skokomish crashes and squeezes through a narrow box canyon. And while the Upper South Fork lacks federal wilderness protection, this area is nothing but pure Olympic wilderness.",
      "A lush, green refuge with 6 miles of trails is the backyard playground for Western Washington University and Fairhaven College in Bellingham.",
      "Take a mile-long stroll along a gravelled trail through abandoned farm fields. This trail is barrier free, and trail maintenance WTA is performing will greatly improve it, making it more wheelchair friendly in the future.",
      "Hike through shady forest, accompanied by the sound of Quartz Creek, little waterfalls, wildflowers and interesting things to see (and eat) on this trail.",
      "The path to Pratt Lake was once a braided super highway, at times more than 10 feet wide. Hardly the stuff of wilderness. But Washington Trails Association (WTA) volunteers stepped in and rebuilt the trail. Not only did they rebuild the tread to channel all hikers onto the proper path, they decommissioned all the unauthorized secondary trails, creating a new single track worthy of a pristine wild area. Hikers can now stroll easily up this picturesque trail to the pretty Pratt Lake basin.",
      "Peabody Creek Loop Trail is a 0.5 mile trail beginning in the Visitor Center parking area.",
      "Meadows, river, and lakes. Smooth trails, gentle climbs, and lots of grassy pastures in which to rest and relax. This route offers a taste of some of the finest meadows, prettiest lakes, and craggiest mountains in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, all in a moderate hike along a picturesque ridge.",
      "Paradise Point State Park packs a lot into a small, often-overlooked park right along I-5.",
      "On Park Butte, hike to an historic fire lookout and come face-to-face with Koma Kulshan. Along with unobstructed panoramic views of Mount Baker, the Twin Sisters, and the rest of the North Cascades, the route to Park Butte offers campsites, wildflower-filled alpine meadows, rushing waterfalls, and a stunning variety of mushroom species.",
      "King County's O'Grady Park is at the center of the Green River Natural Area and it provides a unique place, only a few miles east of the heavily populated Green River valley around Auburn, to get a sense of the river that is wilder, with little noticeable human impact. The site is used mainly by locals, some hikers and Enumclaw Backcountry Horseman. The trail system starts from the parking area for O’Grady and travels down the steep slopes to the Green River.",
      "This hike is a tree hugger's paradise. Huge old growth Douglas firs and hemlocks soar into the sky from a lush green forest floor dotted with woodland flowers. The trail gently ascends only 700 feet in the first four miles, and the slope you hike up is laced by many clear flowing streams bridged by old puncheons.",
      "This is a very old, historic trail. It may have been a Native American trade route across the Olympics. It was rebuilt by the CCC in the 1930's. It was relocated several years ago and re-opened from the Quilcene side through the notch in the Quilcene Range (easily seen from Highway 101.) It climbs steeply through the notch and then traverses along the Quilcene Range.",
      "Accessible from two trailheads, shady Trail 100 provides respite from both the heat of summer and the winds of winter along its approximately 3.5-mile length.",
      "WTA has done some general trail maintenance in this beautiful neighborhood park. The site is extremely valuable from an ecological standpoint.",
      "Enjoy an easy, kid-friendly near-level woodland stroll around one of the largest lakes in the San Juans or a heart-pounding ascent up the islands' highest point. From Mount Constitution's unique stone tower savor stunning views of snow-capped peaks and emerald islands spanning from British Columbia's Garibaldi all the way to Rainier. After fawning and awing, walk along the edge of precipitous cliffs gazing at the twinkling waters of Mountain Lake 1000-feet below. This is the heart of Moran State Park, and when it comes to pure scenery, wildlife observations, and top-notch trails, you'll be hard-pressed to find an area surpassing this.",
      "The Mitchell Peak Trail has two trailheads, the northern access has been closed to the public since 2011. A much longer hike (see Black Hole Falls Hike) is now required to get to summit where a Forest Service fire look out used to perch in beautiful sub-alpine terrain with panorama views of the major SW Washington & Oregon volcanoes.",
      "Take the infrequently-visited upstream trail along the Middle Fork Snoqualmie to a quiet sanctuary just an hour away from I-90.",
      "Explore this loop that begins and ends at the popular Paradise Ranger Station on Mount Rainier. Hike a little more than five miles around and through a myriad of delightful lakes at the base of Washington's tallest volcano."

      "This challenging four-mile hike within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness starts at Deception Pass and heads north to Marmot Lake and Lake Clarice.",
      "This 1.5 mile loop is in Dosewallips State Park right out of the campground. You'll enjoy a moderate climb, which meanders up, down, and all around the park. Amble past waterfalls, through a valley lined with bigleaf maples and western redcedar before switchbacking up to a ridgeline, then return to the campground via a gentle downhill grade.",
      "The Lower Dungeness Trail travels through mostly conifer forests high above the river with a fair bit of elevation gain for a river hike.",
      "Ready for a stunning long hike through the otherwordly landscape of Mount St. Helens? The Loowit Trail reveals the volcano and the blast zone in all its raw glory.",
      "The worst part of this moderate climb is knocked off in the first few miles. After that, the trail rambles along a beautiful, rugged ridge to the west flank of 7487-foot Johnson Peak before turning sharply south to intercept the Angry Mountain Trail.",
      "Located in Liberty Lake County Park, this 8 mile loop hike is an excellent choice on a hot summer day. Views are infrequent, but shade is plentiful. High points include one of the last stands of old growth cedar in Spokane County and a year round waterfall which is very impressive during spring run off.",
      "Step into the moss-cloaked forest of the Lewis River, where giant cedars, nurse logs, ancient stumps and rushing water abound.",
      "The Quinault National Recreation Trail system offers a melange of hiking options to choose from. With nearly 10 miles of well-maintained interconnecting trails, your choices are as varied as spring wildflowers on these popular paths. Trails lead from campgrounds and a historic lodge to waterfalls, cedar bogs, monster trees, and along crystal-clear creeks and a scenic lakeshore. Spend a half day or half a week exploring this delightful area. The Rainforest Lake Loop is one suggestion. Feel free to expand, contract, or combine it with other trails.",
      "The Klickitat Trail is a 31-mile rails-to-trails conversion managed by Columbia Hills State Park. This linear park goes from Lyle to Warwick (on the Lyle-Centerville Highway) with several access points along the way. This Hiking Guide entry describes the route between Lyle and Pitt Road.",
      "The wide sandy beaches of Kalaloch are the perfect introduction to the wild Olympic Coast. Although the highway is never far, towering bluffs and hidden coves give this area a remote feeling. Perfect for children and Rover too (dogs are allowed on these beaches, but they must be leashed), spend days exploring this area's extensive tide pools and headlands. The hike to Browns Point, a jumbled collection of rock islands and surf-splashed cliffs, makes a fine half-day objective.",
      "This scenic trail climbs gently to the shore of June Lake, a small, shallow pool near the timberline on the southern flank of Mount St. Helens. The south bank of the lake is a gorgeous tapered beach of gray sand. While the cinder cone summit is hidden behind a ridge, there are good views of the south end of the Worm Flows, an interesting network of mud and lava flows.",
      "And out and back hike through the forest with gentle hills for the first two miles or so. Eventually joins Icicle Creek at confluence with French Creek. Trail continues beyond.",
      "At the easterly edge of the Pasayten Wilderness, almost touching the Canadian border, lies a truly unique and beautifully remote place. Horseshoe Basin is one of the few places in the Lower 48 to contain arctic tundra and is home to bears, deer and pronghorn sheep, if you know where to look.",
      "Take an amble through moss-laden forest and along churning waters in colors only the Olympic Peninsula can provide. For the most part, it’s ramble with moderate grade, but the last two and a half miles change character dramatically—giving you a steep, thigh-burning workout before rewarding you with views of Mount Mystery and Little Mystery just inside the park boundary.",
      "The wide-open trail to Hannegan Pass and Hannegan Peak offers spectacular mountain views, glorious alpine wildflowers, waterfalls and glaciers. Choose to hike to 5050 foot Hannegan Pass (about 8 miles roundtrip) or press on to the 6200 foot summit of Hannegan Peak -- 10.6 miles roundtrip.",
      "Visit a trail where rushing rivers, placid lakes, and wild forests abound.",
      "Perhaps the loneliest of the Quinault rainforest valleys, Graves Creek promises solitude among a multitude of ancient trees. And while chances are slim of running into other wayward souls, a chance encounter with an elk is possible. Through a deep canyon, Graves Creek booms and crashes on its way to the Quinault River, at times disappearing into a tight chasm. But the valley is never free from its thundering outbursts and explosives rants.",
      "Grand Ridge Park includes 7 miles of WTA-built trail through western red cedar trees, sword ferns, nettles, berries and, at times, slugs. This trail is a little piece of the backcountry close to Seattle and is open to hikers, mountain bikers and equestrians.",
      "Traversing a high ridge due north of Mount St. Helens, this trail offers some of the best views of the volcano's massive crater and huge blast area. Goat Mountain hikers can see the yawning crater and the piled rubble of the new lava dome, as well as the incredible changes to the land in front of the blast.",
      "The Fishtrap area is part of the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington. The deep coulees and canyons were carved by the Great Missoula Floods following the last Ice Age tens of thousands of years ago.",
      "Esmeralda Basin promises hikers the opportunity to walk through old forest, meadows brimming with wildflowers, and along rocky hillsides, all while enjoying the striking scenery of the jagged and craggy Esmeralda Peaks.",
      "This pleasant trail begins at Rainbow Campground on the Olympic Peninsula and ends near Elbo Creek on the northeast side Buck Mountain.",
      "The Necklace Valley makes a wonderful 2-3 night backpack trip for hearty hikers, and rewards with cool alpine lakes to swim and fish in, or just camp beside. Or take a day trip along the East Fork Foss River admire the amazing second-growth tree canopy.",
      "This trail is the access to Bachelor Creek Trail #796, Bachelor Meadows, Cub Lake and the Dome Peak area.",
      "Rhododendrons, old growth, and a river that \"talks\" to you most of the way. The West Fork Dosewallips River spends much of its time on this hike hidden, flowing through a deep narrow canyon. But its constant commotion can continuously be heard through the surrounding primeval forest. At times it bellows, at times it serenades, but it's always a trailside companion. At Big Timber Camp the river swings by, allowing the two of you to become better acquainted.",
      "Day-hikers and backpackers alike visit Lake Dorothy, a very large and beautiful lake less than two miles from the trailhead. Once there, they either rest and play for the day, or continue on to Bear and Deer Lakes, a pair of very pretty smaller lakes deeper in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. The very ambitious press on to remote Snoqualmie Lake. Lake Dorothy can be crowded on summer weekends, but the other lakes see fewer visitors.",
      "The views and beauty on this high come at a steep price. Literally. But those who can soldier through some brutal elevation gain are rewarded by expansive views of breathtaking peaks, and masses of wildflowers on a hike that borders two of Washington's most gorgeous wilderness areas.",
      "The trail climbs sharply through a forest of Douglas fir for a mile to a view of the Goat Rocks, Sawtooth Mountain, Mt. Rainier, and Mt. Adams. From this viewpoint you get a great view of Mt.Adams and the Goat Rocks. It's worth bringing a camera for this one.",
      "Today, this area offers a stunning experience of a native foothills forest meadow--complete with mosquitoes, so come fall through spring to avoid these summer pests."

      "A connector to Military Road along 166th Way SE on Cougar Mountain.",
      "Set beneath two of Washington’s tallest peaks, Colchuck Lake is an alpine gem. It is a larger cousin to the nearby fabled Enchantment Lakes and offers many of the same payoffs – including groves of larches on its far shore – but can be reached with less than half the effort.",
      "All congregants of nature are invited to attend this Church. But hallelujah, it's a tough calling! While the trail is built well, it switchbacks like there's no tomorrow. The scenery is heavenly, but with over 3700 vertical feet to climb there's a little hell to pay on the way. It's worth the sacrifice, though. From the old lookout site just beneath Church Mountain's impressive steeple-like summit, a promised land of North Cascades beauty abounds.",
      "Looking for an early-season backpack featuring craggy, snow-capped peaks, a sapphire-blue lake, a myriad of wildflowers, and a trail that’s regularly maintained by WTA volunteers? The 17-mile thru-hike on the Chelan Lakeshore Trail might be just the thing for you.",
      "The 1930s saw Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) teams building trail in the woods all over America. The Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road benefited from these efforts, which constructed the CCC Road, a 13.5 mile long route that parallels (roughly) the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. The Lower Section can be tricky to navigate, as it borders private property, and signage here can send mixed messages. The trail itself is on DNR land, but be sure to bring an up-to-date map to verify your location as you hike.",
      "The Upper Dungeness Trail is a gateway trail. It is not only a great hike all by itself --on the way to its end at Marmot Pass it links to other high reward hikes in the northeast Olympics – Royal Basin, Goat Lake, Heather Creek, and Home Lake. From Marmot Pass one can continue to either the Upper Big Quilcene or Tubal Cain Trail.",
      "Although this is a short hike, it's a decent challenge because it's a narrow, steep trail. The terrain is interesting, with waterfalls and its trademark basalt columns. If you like solitude, this is the trail for you.",
      "The Bells Mt. trail is a non-motorized, multi-use trail constructed by the Chinook Trail Association (CTA) and managed by the DNR. It is part of a 30-mile stretch of the Chinook Trail that was awarded National Recreation Trail Status in 2005.",
      "Due to the permanent closure of the Carbon River Road, hikers can now park at the washout and venture to the end of the road. From there, the trail takes hikers a further 4.2 miles to the toe of the impressive Carbon Glacier.",
      "Battle Ground Lake State Park is a local favorite, particularly good for families with its short loop around the lake and the playground.",
      "This hike along Baker Lake is a busy, popular trail in summer. It is a nice off season walk though, and is perfect on a crisp, clear winter day. With the leaves off the trees, views that aren't possible in summer emerge; the surrounding peaks and the mossy green silhouettes of the leafless maple trees cover the hillside. A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction.",
      "Find incredible spring wildflowers and one of the best ridge hikes in the Gorge; just be prepared for a difficult drive to get there. While Dog Mountain to the south is crowded, you’ll have these sweeping vistas to yourself. WTA volunteers are taking on a major trail restoration effort to be completed in 2015.",
      "The Augspurger Mountain Trail offers a great loop option to the popular Dog Mountain Trail. The two trails share the same trailhead, but the Augspurger trail heads off to the west. The way is more gentle, and a 1.5 mile connector trail links the two together. Along the way, enjoy bouncy balsamroot blooms in May and fantastic views of the Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood and more all year round.",
      "This short loop just off of Interstate 90 offers an easy escape to nature. With plenty to keep little ones occupied, and just enough mileage to give your legs a little workout, this is a delightful detour for anyone venturing west or east over Snoqualmie Pass.",
      "This 100+ acre park near Edmonds is on the eastern shores of its namesake, Lake Ballinger. Fishing is available year round, and with beach access, barbeques, and picnic tables, it is an excellent place to spend an afternoon with the family.",
      "Enjoy breath taking views of the Olympics from a secluded cove with many different types of seabirds and wildlife. Try to keep your feet dry while exploring a series of trails amid the historic 184-acre Guillemot Cove Nature Reserve.",
      "Climb the second-highest peak on the Kitsap Peninsula for good views of Puget Sound, the Seattle skyline, and Mount Rainier. Of course there are views of the Olympics too, and on the way down you'll get a pretty darn good look at them. This is a working forest, but most of the way is shaded by a cool canopy of evergreens.",
      "Ruston Way runs along the Tacoma Waterfront from Commencement Park to Point Defiance Park.",
      "",
      "Follow a fisherman's trail to a crystalline blue lake in the North Cascades. This is a bushwhack, so you will need route-finding experience and a map and compass, and you'll need to know how to use them.",
      "This short hike to the top of Patterson Mountain provides great views across and along the Methow Valley from Twisp to Mazama, while to the west lies the Sawtooth Range.",
      "Thank goodness the Salmon la Sac area has plenty of roads because they keep the snowmobilers off quiet trails like this one that parallels Cooper River upstream to Cooper Lake. T",
      "Hike to an old mining town by ambling up a long-closed road along the South Fork Sauk River and largely sticking to the old route taken by miners over a century ago.",
      "Hike a trail built mostly of boardwalk planking through peaty bogs beside three quiet little lakes. Established campsites with fire pits, benches and tent platforms await a weekend of camping with the kids. This trail also makes a pleasant weekday hike for those with creaky knees, as it is not difficult. As you hike, enjoy the many plants and animals that make the lowland bog environment home.",
      "Survey Mount St. Helens’ recovering Blast Zone and get 360-degree, four-peak views from this high perch along the Boundary Trail.",
      "This early or late-season hike takes you for a ridge walk high above Coldwater Lake, which was not a standing body of water prior to the massive eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. You'll walk through a serene willow forest, marvel at the power of nature when you encounter twisted hulks of logging machinery, and see plenty of gnarled stumps where tall ev",
      "Offering spectacular views of the three southern volcanoes (Rainier, St. Helens and Adams), lakes, meadows and wildlife over relatively moderate terrain, Section H is the perfect starting point for the Washington portion of the Pacific Crest Trail.",
      "A short connector trail to the Snipes Mountain trail and other adventures on the southern flanks of Mount Adams.",
      "This trail only takes about 20 minutes to hike out and back with great views of Mount Baker, Mount Erie, Fidalgo Island, Hope Island and the inner part of Puget Sound.",
      "Rolling along the lower slope of Mount Adams, this trail offers mountain views and, during the early season, a forest floor carpeted with lush clumps of beargrass with bulbous white flowers. Though much of the trail is under the old fir and pine forest canopy, there are enough breaks and clearings to keep Mount Adams frequently in view. The best panoramas of the peak are found from the saddle between 5272-foot Crofton Butte and its little sibling to the south, Lower Butte (4870 feet)."

From there you can continue on to Sheep Lake or head off-trail to check out Crystal Lake at the edge of the tree line.",
      "Climb the north side of the mountain to spectacular alpine tundra and panoramic views on Devil's Garden, situated on a high plateau below the heavily-crevassed Lava and Lyman Glaciers, then head down to Avalanche Valley below the rugged and remote northeast side of the mountain. You'll make two challenging stream crossings before reaching Devil's Garden.",
      "Take this remote, flower-filled trail up the north side of Mount Adams to the rocky alpine terrain of giant glaciers.",
      "Although it can get crowded on the weekends, there is plenty of room for seclusion on either a day hike or an overnight stay. Some of the best views and meadows within the Mt. Adams Wilderness.",
      "Anyone who has climbed Mount Adams knows the mountain isn't a cakewalk. This is a big rock with lots of snow and ice, and it requires a se-rious commitment to get even halfway up. That said, there was a time when men not only climbed the peak to mine sulfur from the summit vents, they led mules to the summit. Yes, mules. There remain a few traces of that old mule trail visible on the upper mountain-when the snowpack is light and nearly melted off, you can still see the trail pounded into the pumice of the upper mountains.",
      "Mount Adams, at 12,276 feet, dominates the South Cascades and provides the most dramatic scenery of the region. The mountain is a standout destination also for the massive basalt lava beds that cover large portions of the surrounding landscape. This relatively young volcano initially formed nearly a million years ago, about 3 miles southeast of its current location. That first cone was ground down by glaciers during the long succession of ice ages that swept the region, while the \"hot spot\" that gave birth to the mountain shifted northwest as plate tectonics and continental drift rearranged the landscape.",
      "This forested trail leads to a fine campsite primed for exploring the base of Mount Adams.",
      "This is a good place for kids to come and explore. The Pacific Crest Trail ducks the western face of Potato Hill, but the gentle cone can be climbed without much effort or difficulty. The scramble to the top is worth the effort, as it brings wonderful views of Mount Adams and the volcanic landscape of the country north of the mountain. One of the most impressive sights is the sprawling Muddy Fork Lava Bed that seems to flow from the perfect cone of Red Butte (7200 feet) on Adams's northeast slope.",
      "Burnt Rock is an appropriate name for the black mound of basalt piled up near Sheep Lake. The rock is one of the many upthrusts of volcanic rock in this area of massive lava beds, and Sheep Lake is a cool pool of sparkling water nestled in the folds of lava near the base of Burnt Rock. The trail passes a few small barren lava beds, some deep old-growth pine and cedar forests, and fields of huckleberries big enough to satisfy the hunger of a battalion of bears and an army of hikers.",
      "A very challenging but very nice scramble. Goat Flats is gorgeous and the ladders to the lookout are invigorating. The views from the lookout can be incredible.",
      "Venture to where the deer and the mountain goats play-to a precipitous ridge above a massive glacier on Three Fingers, one of the most prominently recognizable peaks in the Cascades. En route take in ancient forest, a pastoral mountain lake, and acres of amazing meadows and parklands punctuated with tarns. And did I mention the bountiful berry patches?",
      "",
      "Alta Mountain is a rocky summit featuring 360 degree views of Rainier, Hibox, and the Chikamins. It can be done as a long day hike, but is more easily enjoyed as a side trip from an overnight at Lila Lake, Rampart Lakes, or even Rachel Lake.",
      "You will see plenty in the first 7.2 miles of this trip that take you to the shores of Royal Lake, but you should plan your hike to have the time –and energy -- to enjoy the wildflower-dotted alpine basin and its milky blue tarns in Upper Royal Basin about three-quarters of a mile past the lake.",
      "A hike along the mighty Elwha River is a trip into the very heart of the Olympic Peninsula. From its remote point of origin on the rugged southern slopes of Mount Barnes, practically at the exact center of the national park, the Elwha flows 45 miles to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, draining over 300 square miles of surrounding wilderness and passing through one of the largest tracts of old growth left in America. But you don't need to travel far to experience this historic and wildlife-rich river valley. The hike to Lillian River, one of the Elwha's major tributaries, will suffice.",
      "Take a short, steep hike from the Whiskey Bend Road down 400 feet to an overlook of the Elwha River. The area here is rugged, and erosion has caused the end of the trail to wash away, so be careful!",
      "Formerly a trail that bordered Lake Mills, the Smokey Bottom trail winds through the second-growth forest along the now free-flowing Elwha River.",
      "Take a short but very scenic hike starting from the Altair campground in Olympic National Park. Traverse along the edge of the Elwha River, recently free-flowing thanks to the removal of the Glines Canyon Dam.",
      "Take a hike on the east side of Tiger Mountain along an old railroad grade.",
      "When looking for solitude or a quiet, cool creek to ramble along, look no further than Canyon Creek. This trail’s gentle tread and easy grade were cut long ago for horse-pack trains. Along this old supply route to the mines there are numerous babbling brooks, and other natural wonders to keep you entertained. Once this river trail could be followed all the way to Chancellor and then into the Pasayten Wilderness or towards Harts Pass. Alas, wash outs now close the trail five miles in at Mill Creek.",
      "This is a large lake hidden just south of Tonga Ridge in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Reached by a brushy, boot-beaten fisherman's path, it is less visited than many lakes in the area, but the route is marked on the map, and if you are willing to put up with a bit of inconvenience, this makes a nice day hike or overnight.",
      "The lesser known creek between Bean and Stafford, Standup offers a gentle valley followed by steepness to an open hillside and ridge with views.",
      "Gorgeous weather and late-season color make this one of the most beautiful autumn hikes in Mount Rainier National Park. This hike is a tough climb, but the payoff is great views and lots of solitude.",
      "Follow a short, ADA-accessible path around Picture Lake, home to one of the most photographed vistas in America. Featuring a backdrop of craggy Mount Shuksan and a foreground of wilflowers ringing a sparkling lake in summer, Picture Lake is pretty as, well, a picture.",
      "This watershed hike offers water crossings, swaying bridges, beautiful views close to Bothell, and birds galore!",
      "No need to head all the way to the Pacific if it's a good beach hike you seek. One of Washington's best saltwater strolls is along its \"north coast, \"the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Actually, this hike heads directly into the strait on the longest coastal spit in the continental United States. A narrow strip of sand, dune, and beached logs, the Dungeness Spit protrudes over 5 miles straight into the strait. Prone to breaching during storms, the spit is also resilient and well-established-and well-hiked and loved by those who explore it.",
      "Just south of the village of La Push are three Olympic Coast charms: First, Second, and Third Beaches. Each one is sandy and broad and hemmed in by dramatic bluffs and headlands. And while they're in close proximity to each other, you can't hike from one to the next because those headlands block the way. With roadside access, First Beach is the easiest to get to and so can be crowded. Third Beach requires a 1.2-mile slog down a forested trail. But Second Beach is just right: a hike just long enough to discourage crowds, yet short enough to encourage all who want to see this beautiful beach.",
      "This park, in the middle of West Seattle, has 1.7 miles of hiking trails in a natural forest setting, and offers the opportunity to see old growth conifers that once were common in Puget Sound forests.",
      "Starting from valley bottom, the Huckleberry Mountain Trail is one of the last \"complete\" trails left in the North Cascades. A half century of aggressive logging severed many of our trails from their valley roots (or worse, obliterated them). Miraculously, Huckleberry Mountain's trail and more importantly its forests were spared this fate. On this trail you can propel yourself back in time to when it took time to reach coveted summits and high ridges. But more than mere time is required for this trek; you'll also need excellent endurance and a good cardiovascular system."

      "Most people come to Lime Kiln State Park for the whale watching. It's one of the best places in the country to view orcas from land. But don't stop there; venture beyond to see a century-old lighthouse and an historic lime kiln.",
      "Who wants to hike in old clear-cuts? When they're packed with huckleberries, I do! If the huckleberries aren't ripe yet, you'll find paintbrush, lupine, columbine, and other wildflowers coloring the trail. Besides, the old clear-cuts found on the lower portion of this route peter out quickly as you climb the ridge before dropping into the picturesque lake basin.",
      "Coal Creek Falls is a wonderful destination for any day hiker looking for an easy and/or family friendly trail with a picturesque culmination at Coal Creek Falls. It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy and a dense understory with many wildflower species in the spring.",
      "Lake Ethel is a beautiful lake in the Chiwaukum Mountains of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, just east of the Stevens Pass. Lake Ethel is one of the ‘Scottish Lakes’, which includes nearby Lake Donald, Loch Eileen and Lake Julius. The entire Scottish Lakes area is great for solitude. From Lake Ethel there are numerous options to extend your trip for backpacking or long day hikes.",
      "Visit a the site of an old fire lookout, where you'll have views for miles in all directions on a clear day. Along the way, you'll enjoy wildflowers of many varieties, beargrass, and plump huckleberries in the summertime.",
      "An easy loop from the Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort, perfect for early or late-season hiking. Ramble beneath towering old trees to a misty, mossy ravine that the Sol Duc River careens into. Watch determined dippers hunt for insects in the splash zone. Return along the pristine river until the fetid smell of sulfur signals you've arrived back at the springs.",
      "The Blue Lakes High Route ascends a steep, cairn-dotted trail to a high pass with a beautiful view across to Johnson Mountain and down to a sometimes frozen Blue Lake in a rocky basin below.",
      "A loop hike, beginning and ending in the old-growth forests of the North Fork Sauk River that traverses high ridges and passes of the Pacific crest, visits beautiful alpine lakes, and finally follows the high and lonesome Pilot Ridge Trail before descending back down to the trail junction on the North Fork Sauk River.",
      "Access to such a grand location, with such ease, should be illegal. For the low admission price of a half dozen miles one can gain entrance to a primordial world of receding glaciers, wildflower carpeted meadows, and purple mountains majesties. The last mile to the lake will test many hikers’ nerves but the rewards are worth it. This pond is an excellent destination unto itself. It is also a stepping stone to more ambitious cross country ramblings in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.",
      "Visit this trail in the springtime and you can expect to see an explosion of wildflower color! At more than 4500 feet in 5.5 miles of trail, the route to the old Icicle Ridge Lookout site is quite an undertaking, but the views and the flowers are truly worth the energy it takes to get up there.",
      "Often free of snow as early as April, this excellent early season hike offers hikers what they have been missing for months: a good chance of sun (this being the sunny side of the Cascades, a bountiful array of wildflowers, and stunning views of Tumwater and Icicle Canyon, the Wenatchee and Icicle rivers and surrounding mountains.",
      "Don't let this hike's bad reputation dissuade you from reaping its good views. Sure, it's one of the snakiest trails in the Icicle Valley-save it for a cool day. And yeah, it's one of the steepest trails in the valley-hottest too-best to save it for a cool day. And total vertical feet-oh boy, you'll gain plenty-so save it for a cool day when the serpents are sedate. Are you getting the picture? But the views are amazing: from the Chiwaukum to the Entiat to the Stuart ranges and beyond-savor the panorama on any day!",
      "A 30+ mile hike on the west side of Lake Chelan, from Holden Village to High Bridge at the north end of Stehekin.",
      "This is a great weekend backpacking trip for wildflower lovers. Miles of wildflowers along Meander Meadow and Cady Ridge will delight the hiker who passes through during July and August. Fantastic views of the Cascades, Glacier Peak and plunging valleys add to the allure, and it's all packaged up in a 16-mile loop.",
      "There's nothing macabre about this peak. Au contraire, Poe's open summit ushers joyous tell-tale views of ridges, valleys, and sprawling peaks. One of the Poet Peaks, a name bestowed upon the prominent points of the Wenatchee Ridge by none other than A. H. Sylvester, Poe is not the highest, but it's the easiest to ascend. Still, this former lookout site is no easy climb. The way is steep and exposed to the eastern-slope sun-hot. But the extensive alpine views from Poe will leave you raven for some time!",
      "Two glacier-fed pristine rivers flow through corridors of gargantuan cedars that were old when Columbus, Cabot, and Cartier washed up on the eastern seaboard. This is a pleasant hike early or late season, crowds are nil, and chances are always good of spotting bears or other large woodland critters. Indian Creek is one of the best hikes in the vicinity for admiring ancient forest or when you want the wilderness all to yourself.",
      "Dirty Face Lookout is one of the earliest high Central Cascade trails to melt out. At four miles and with 4000 feet of elevation gain, the trail provides hikers with a very good workout. Along the way, you'll have lots to look at, as the elevation change can roll an entire season of wildflowers into a single hike. Rock roses and paintbrush bob near the trailhead, while avalanche lilys sway in the breeze near the summit. When you aren't looking at the wildflowers, the vistas are outstanding.",
      "Follow the Little Wenatchee River all the way to its headwaters high on the Cascade crest. From mile-high, miles-long alpine meadows, the river meanders. And so will you upon reaching these heavenly flower gardens. The hike in is a long approach and is warm at times across brushy avalanche slopes, but it is worth every ounce of sweat expended and every annoying fly swatted.",
      "Merritt Lake is nestled under Nason Ridge a dozen miles east of Stevens Pass. This is just far enough from the crest to leave west side clouds behind. This hike is an under-appreciated one in the Stevens Pass area, so you may be lucky enough to enjoy a relatively uncrowded hike.",
      "A hike/scramble from Merritt Lake to the summit of Mount Mastiff. Climbing gear and experience and route-finding skills required.",
      "This is a fantastic trip -- amble along a river before making a steep climb to breathtaking ridge walks and astounding views of the craggy Cascades.",
      "Hike a trail that traverses Nason Ridge. Along the way, you'll enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding summits, as well as access to an old fire lookout.",
      "What are you up for today? One of Nason Ridge's prominent peaks or dramatic lakes? Either way it's going to cost you big time in sweat expended and calories burned to reach them. The way is steep, hot, and entails a whole lot of vertical rise. But the trailhead is easy to reach, the trail is in good shape, and views are practically nonstop. And did I mention all the flowers?",
      "Sometimes, taking the back door is better. At 9 miles and 3600 feet of elevation gain, the back way to the Rock Mountain Lookout is less steep, more scenic, and two miles shorter than the more frequently used route from Rock Lake. Try this as a key swap or a thru-hike if you want to get both sides of this gorgeous hike.",
      "Mount McCausland delivers mountain views, lake views, and even solitude at the summit. The cost? The first three miles of the trail is easy, but the last half mile to the summit is steep and occasionally brushy. Taking a break on that climb is no hardship, though: the hillside is carpeted in berries and the views start early.",
      "Hike to a pair of pristine lakes, one quite large, both quite shallow, surrounded by big timber and wedged in a deep valley between the steep and jagged Dirtyface and Chiwawa ridges. The hike isn't overly difficult, but the terrain it traverses is rugged and remote. One of only three trails affording access into the wild Napeequa River valley, it's a brief affair here, but satisfying nevertheless, with good glimpses into this forbidding and magical corner of the Cascades.",
      "Three miles of easy hiking on Whitepine Creek #1582 leads you to Wildhorse Creek Tr#1592, which in about 6.5 miles takes you due south to Frosty Pass, Icicle Ridge Tr#1570, and Frosty Ck Tr#1592. It accesses Lake Grace, Big Chiwaukum, Snowgrass Mtn., and Doelle Lakes. Over half of this charming trail is above 5000' in wide-open country.",
      "There are two trails to Poe Mountain: the original steep supply route to the retired fire lookout via a trail rising from the Little Wenatchee Falls campground, and the more moderate trail via the Irving Pass Trail. Irving Pass is the recommended route, since you spend a significant amount of the hike on the ridge with awesome views both north and south.",
      "Heather Lake is a moderate day hike to an attractive lake just below the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), particularly good for families. There are huckleberries in season and a dive into the lake will refresh hikers in the warmth of August.",
      "This is a beautiful small lake tucked immediately under Grizzly Peak and the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Where Heather Lake is often shared with a number of hiking and camping groups, you are pretty much assured to have lunch by yourself at Glasses. Only a half a dozen trip reports have been filed in the last decade, this is a good predictor of solitude."

      "A short, self guided nature trail near Newhalem. See a wide variety of native plants and animals along this hike that is great for kids.",
      "Hike to the largest of three gorgeous backcountry lakes set in deep scoured cirques, or scramble up a narrow spine to Trappers Peak to snag some of the best alpine viewing this side of the Continental Divide. Both destinations will cost you dearly in caloric output. Lots of elevation gain over steep and rough terrain is what keeps this day-hike-accessible corner of the North Cascades National Park from being overrun.",
      "Don’t be fooled by the name – the way to Easy Pass is anything but easy. But the reward for your efforts is an eastside gateway into the stunning North Cascades National Park. At the pass, you’re greeted by trickling streams of snowmelt and views of the peaks of Golden Horn and Mount Henry to the east. Venturing further west, gaze into the Park, with awe-inspiring glacially carved river valleys, dark gray craggy massifs of Fisher Peak and Mount Logan dotted with snowfields or cloaked by glaciers, and a host of wildflowers.",
      "There are two ways to attain Fourth of July Pass - from Thunder Creek or from Panther Creek. Both offer wonderful opportunities to travel along burbling, blue-green creeks. Both offer excellent views of the North Cascades and camping possibilities. Go out and back or stash a second car and do a traverse.",
      "The mountainous views that once inspired beatnik poets continue to inspire modern-day hikers who take on this strenuous yet rewarding challenge.",
      "An old pack trail reincarnated, Happy-Panther is both one of the oldest and newest trails in the North Cascades National Park Complex.",
      "An old roadbed that has been converted into a trail.",
      "This ADA-accessible trail built on a dike on the edge of this small town is a lovely jaunt, clocking in at just over three miles roundtrip, along a section of the Cowlitz River. A mountain bike course, playground, and several picnic areas dot the trailside, and with various access points to the town of Castle Rock, it’s easy to duck off for a quick bite in town.",
      "Often called the jewel of Longview, this man-made lake in Southwest Washington is a delightful way to spend a couple of hours. Maple trees blaze red, orange and yellow in autumn, willows provide shade in spring, and the stark skeletons of those trees stand out against grey skies in winter. With various bridges crossing it, it's possible to venture all the way around it, or create smaller loops as needed",
      "The Golden Gate trail provides a quick route to amazing panoramas of Mount Rainier and the craggy peaks of the Tatoosh Range. Pass through wildflower-studded alpine meadows, a clear sparkling stream, and up a steep, well-maintained trail. You can even make it a loop, if you want to explore the lush parkland at the foot of Washington's tallest mountain.",
      "If you need to take a break before braving the traffic coming back into Seattle on a Sunday evening, or if you want to stretch your legs on the way over the pass to adventures in Leavenworth, the Skyline Lake Trail is just the thing.",
      "Green, mossy old growth trees and miles of level hiking are the main attractions at Federation Forest State Park. More than 12 miles of trails wind through the forest and hikers can put together loops to fit their hiking needs.",
      "With lovely Douglas-fir forest, wetlands, and a great network of trails, Island Center Forest is one of King County's best-kept secrets. Birds are abundant on the wetlands, and the forest is lush, with large, second-growth trees, a testament to the effort that several groups have put into managing this forest in order to restore the health of this area.",
      "Coldwater Lake Trail is a 8-9 mile out and back trail located near Toutle, Washington that features a lake and is rated as moderate. The trail is primarily used for hiking and is accessible from April until November.",
      "The loop around Mountain Lake is the perfect way to spend a relaxing day on Orcas Island. If part of your crew is interested in the more challenging Mount Constitution, this is a good way to while away the time that they're trekking to the top.",
      "The Domerie Peak trail takes you steeply up mountainsides on the dry side of Snoqualmie Pass. Once at the summit, hike a ridgeline traverse with views of Lake Cle Elum and the foothills below. You'll arrive at Mount Baldy about halfway through the Domerie Peak trail, which can be thru-hiked down to a separate trailhead at Domerie Creek.",
      "Accessible via two separate trailheads, the Domerie Peak trail offers a ridgeline traverse with views of Cle Elum Lake and the surrounding peaks of the Teanaway.",
      "The east side of Mount Adams is a world unto itself. Though all of Adams is in the dry zone of the Cascades, the eastern side of the big volcano, espe-cially along the black-rock scar of the Aiken Lava Bed, is dry as a bone. This route explores the sparse pine forests flanking the edge of that massive ancient river of molten rock that is the Aiken Lava Bed.",
      "It's appropriate that this hike begins in the heart of Issaquah. In the language of the native tribes, Ishquowh means \"sound of water birds.\" The raspy name of this mountain destination, meanwhile, comes from the raucous calls of the herons that migrate through this area in the spring and fall--their mighty squak, squak, squak! echoes off the forested slopes of Squak Mountain.",
      "The Rock Trail is one of WTA's signature projects, built from scratch thanks to WTA’s partnerships with various organizations, including Larrabee State Park and Chuckanut Conservancy. A dedicated group of enthusiastic WTA volunteers worked countless hours here, carving a connector trail out of the steep, rugged hillside from the top of Cleator Road to the South Lost Lake Trail. The Rock Trail provides hikers and trail runners a steep climb, gorgeous views, and a peek at the area's fascinating geology.",
      "Put on your conductors hat and take a hike through railroad history. The old tunnels, rusting relics, cement snow sheds and the big red caboose should appeal to kids of all ages.",
      "The William O. Douglas Wilderness is a water lover's paradise, but is best visited in late summer and fall. The endless ponds, puddles, and lakes also mean endless bugs. Once a few cold nights have thinned the biting population, you'll be able to enjoy unmatched wilderness rambling among sprawling meadows and potholes. You're in the home range of elk here--and black bear territory too. This hike is a good introduction to the nearly infinite array of loops possible in the William O. Douglas, passing by the dual pools of Twin Lakes, under the shadow of Tumac Mountain's cratered volcanic summit, around Blankenship Lakes, through the sprawling Blankenship Meadows, and, of course, across the heart of Mosquito Valley.",
      "Spectacle Lake is truly worthy of the name - it's quite a sight to see. Nestled at the base of Chikamin Ridge and just a short jaunt from the Pacific Crest Trail, this lake is one of the true gems of Snoqualmie Pass.",
      "This is a long, steep climb to a prominent peak perched smack-dab in the middle of some of the finest mountain scenery in North America. Mounts Baker and Shuksan breathe their frosty breaths upon you. A choppy sea of jagged peaks from British Columbia to the Picket Range washes up upon your boots. Gaze out to salty waters or deep into the heart of the North Cascades wilderness. And best of all, you wont' be competing for space on the summit. The crowds are over at nearby Hannegan Peak.",
      "Venture up a wide and deep valley to peaceful meadows in the heart of the Entiat Mountains. While nearby trails swarm with hikers and horseback riders, you'll more than likely only be sharing this route with ground squirrels and deer and perhaps a shy bear. While any distance along this trail makes for a nice early season wilderness probe, to reach the meadows you must ford Rock Creek twice, which is usually safe only late in the season.",
      "The Pete Lake trail is a mild-mannered path with something to offer for hikers, campers, children, birders, wildlife enthusiasts, and aquaphiles. This even-tempered route follows the Cooper River 4.5 miles to its headwater, passing through a diverse old-growth forest and terminating at an alpine lake sitting in the shadows of Big Summit Chief and Chimney Rock.",
      "Seven lakes, seas of wildflowers, summer huckleberries, a bevy of wildlife and a good chance of quiet solitude await you on this 9-mile out-and-back. What more could you ask for?",
      "This hike up to a former lookout site provides spectacular views of Mount Rainier and the surrounding landscape.",
      "Dalles Ridge is the primary way that hikers access the popular Noble Knob Trail and Ranger Creek. It provides hikers with a beautiful ridge walk after a steady climb from the trailhead.",
      "The Big Tree Trail is a short (0.5 mile) trail on Tiger Mountain's Tradition Plateau. It passes one of the largest Douglas firs still standing in the Tigers, and also passes a short section of some of the best true swamp you will find in the area, with lots of hanging moss and standing water."

      "The Skyline Trail is the main route for hiking out of Paradise, Mount Rainier’s south side hub and most popular destination, providing visitors a unique opportunity to experience the breathtaking beauty of Washington’s grandest mountain. Even before the historic Paradise Inn was constructed in 1916, the Paradise valley has long been one of the state’s most beloved hiking destinations because of it's southern exposure, giving it a longer season than its north side counterpart, Sunrise. In peak season (July and August) your trip along the Skyline Trail will be filled with views of cascading waterfalls, mighty glaciers and subalpine meadows brimming with colorful splashes of lupines, mountain heather, scarlet paintbrush, cascade asters and bistort.",
      "This King County park offers a getaway that's less than an hour from Seattle. Join other outdoor enthusiasts on the trails of Tolt-MacDonald, balance on a suspension bridge, and if that's not enough, join up with the Snoqualmie Valley Trail and take a jaunt along its 27-mile length.",
      "A brutally steep trail-one of the steepest in the Icicle Creek valley-the way to Bootjack may well have you ripping your boots off once you're down, eager to soak your sore tootsies. But the relentless climb is worth it, delivering you to a high ridge where alpine breezes whistle through silver snags and dazzling wild-flowers dance beneath them. Then follow a scramble path to Bootjack's summit, where it's the knockout panoramic views that will knock your boots off.",
      "Some of the biggest, oldest trees in the Washington Cascades stand tall in the Grove of the Patriarchs. These silent old men of moss tower overhead, with a few lying down to show us just how massive the trunks really are. The Grove resides in a low, boggy area across the Ohanapecosh River, so you'll need to cross a sweet little suspension bridge to get there, offering you a chance to enjoy a bit of adventure on this simple little trail. Youngsters typically love the bridge, and kids of all ages marvel at the massive trees.",
      "Do a through-hike on the main Tiger Mountain Trail, also known as the TMT. Arrange a car shuffle and start at the southern end. Hike north more than fifteen miles over varied terrain and through different types of forest vegetation. Pass a large glacial erratic boulder, and visit some of the most remote places in the Tigers.",
      "Looking for the perfect first hike for young kids? Eaten too much bratwurst in Leavenworth and need a walk in the woods to settle your stomach? Want a moderate flat snowshoe with a beautiful winter destination? The short trail to Hidden Lake adjacent to Lake Wenatchee is the answer to all of these requests.",
      "Pocket wilderness, backyard wilderness, urban wilderness-all are appropriate descriptions of the sprawling forested ridge between the cities of Snohomish and Monroe known as Lord Hill. Over 1400 acres of this emerald upland on the Snohomish River are protected from development within Snohomish County's Lord Hill Regional Park, providing excellent outdoor wanderings close to ever-burgeoning Puget Sound cities.",
      "Walk along a bay where the Skagit River meets the Salish Sea. This estuary at the saltwater edge of the Skagit River delta is eight miles long and three miles across, and you can walk a portion of it. This hike can be enjoyed by almost anyone in any season. The easy flat walking make this an ideal hike for those just starting to hike, or someone recovering from injury or illness. Birders will definitely want to bring the binoculars! Before you start, be sure to check out the large tree on the road to the trailhead, there is a pair of bald eagles that sometimes hang out here.",
      "Trekking quietly is easy on this gentle woodland trail, allowing you to take advantage of prime wildlife spotting.",
      "Take a short hike up to these lakes in the Stevens Pass Ski Area.",
      "An informative 0.9 mile loop hike through the forest.",
      "Hike this easy leg stretcher while taking in the beautiful scenery of the North Cascades Highway. A good stop if you have a car full of restless children or you are showing off the area to visiting relatives. The views from the top are a big payoff for such a short hike.",
      "Holden Lake is set in a fantastic glacial basin, with stunning views of Bonanza, the highest non-volcanic peak in Washington State.",
      "A fine trail for those willing to climb to get to great views in a remote part of the North Cascades National Park. Best done as a side trip off an overnight trip from Rainy Pass to Stehekin, or something similar.",
      "This hike goes up through lovely, shady forest to a junction with the Pacific Northwest Trail.",
      "Gold Mountain is a beautiful hike from the Gold Creek Trailhead up a logging road and across country. With spectacular views of the Hood Canal and the Olympics to the west, as well as Mount Rainier, the Cascades, and Bremerton to the east, this is a definitely a half day hike you must experience.",
      "From the shores of Reflection Lake, this trail leads down jumbled talus slopes to the cold blue waters of Louise Lake, a pretty pool beneath the rocky wall of lower Mazama Ridge. The trail is gentle and kid-friendly, and since access is so easy, it makes a great stroll on a hot summer day.",
      "A stroll along the sand dunes of Deception State Park's West Beach offers a glimpse into this important geologic feature. The way is easy and interpretive signs provide information about the interesting seaside vegetation unique to this area.",
      "If the name Kendall Katwalk conjures up an image of a narrow pathway blasted out of a steeply sloped rock face, that’s part of it. But the whole package includes old growth forest, gorgeous wildflowers, and stunning views into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness from both sides of the pass below Kendall Peak, where the Katwalk begins.",
      "Ain't it Grand! When viewed from a distant vantage point, Grand Park looks as though a scythe sheared off the top of a mountain, leaving a flat, mesalike meadow sprawling across the forested horizon.",
      "Pretty lakes with grand Rainier views in a blueberry-strewn basin below Tatoosh Ridge",
      "With four miles of beach walking and water on three sides, Damon Point is one of the best places to hike and view wildlife in the North Beach area of Washington's Pacific Coast.",
      "Experience the Pacific Crest Trail at its finest. This backpacking trip takes you across four passes to two lovely alpine lakes in the shadow of Golden Horn, Tower Mountain and Mount Hardy.",
      "With five miles of shoreline in South Puget Sound, the Woodard Bay Conservation Area includes forests, wetlands of freshwater, as well as historic and cultural resources that are a valuable diversion in the area.",
      "Hiking American Ridge to American Lake you may find yourself feasting in the same huckleberry fields Douglas himself once enjoyed.",
      "As the largest urban park in Pierce County, the network of roads and trails weaving through the forest preserve provides a quiet retreat for joggers, cyclists, and hikers.",
      "Nisqually is an excellent year-round destination for wildlife viewing and photography.",
      "Red Top Lookout, built in 1952, restored in 1997, and still operational today, provides a fine bang for your hiking buck. A short, steep trail leads to the functioning fire lookout as well as magnificent 360 degree views of the Stuart Range, Teanaway Ridge, Chelan and Entiat Mountains, Mount Rainier, and even Mount Adams on a clear day.",
      "Magnificent old growth forests, stellar views of Mount Baker, turbulent tributaries, and, of course, a beautiful lake make this trail a great path to travel.",
      "Hike along a Wild and Scenic river, up a rugged ridge, and to a mirror-like iconic lake in Glacier Peak wilderness. This is a long hike, best done as a backpack, but it's absolutely worth the days you invest to explore here."

      "Hike through a deep green ravine sliced by a salmon-spawning stream in Lynnwood of all places. But there's more; finish at a quiet Puget Sound beach with sweeping views of Whidbey Island and the Olympic Mountains. Lunds Gulch forms a green swath in heavily suburbanized south Snohomish County. Protected within the 105-acre Meadowdale County Park, Lunds Gulch is not only a refuge to area wildlife, but also to area residents.",
      "Three peaks in a day! It's completely doable thanks to this loop that takes you on a tour of Mount Kit Carson, Day Mountain, and Mount Spokane. Plus there is plenty to see along the way -- don't forget your camera!",
      "The Kettle Crest National Scenic Trail is the granddaddy of long-distance, high-country routes in Eastern Washington. Over the course of its 44 miles, it presents a virtual highlight reel of dry-side beauty, from sage-scented meadows to subalpine parkland.",
      "Spectacular rolling hills, far off views and a flower explosion make this little-known gem a destination to explore and roam through. It's one of the few places hikers can see sagebrush growing side-by-side with sub-alpine larch.",
      "",
      "Hike along the spine of the Columbia Highlands, where views extend west to the Cascades, east to the Selkirks, and north to Canada.",
      "WTA recently constructed this new trail to the top of Guemes Mountain on Guemes Island. The one-mile trail will lead to an incredible viewpoint overlooking nearby islands and ocean straits, the Skagit River delta, and the volcanoes and jagged spires of the North Cascades.",
      "This grand tour of Mount Spokane State Park includes all eight summits within Washington's largest state park.",
      "The 0.7-mile interpretive trail from the upper falls viewpoints to the lower falls viewpoint is family- and pet-friendly, good for beginners, teaches the basics of the flora and fauna near Snoqualmie Pass, informs about local Native American culture, and ends with impressive views of a Washington icon.",
      "Named for the lovable curmudgeon who refused to leave his homestead when St. Helens was on the brink of erupting, Harry’s Ridge offers a fascinating panorama of the restless giant, still smoking and belching occasionally, years after her devastating awakening.",
      "With all due respect to the Bard, what's in a mountain? That which we call Mount Rose by any other name would still be as steep. This is a challenging hike-one of the steepest trails in the Olympics. Great for conditioning, Rose offers a few scenic rewards too, from beautiful high-elevation old-growth forests to a knockout view of Lake Cushman from 3500 feet directly above it. Consider Rose an alternative to Mount Ellinor. When half of Olympia is crowding Ellinor's summit like goats at a salt lick, you just might be savoring the sweet offerings of Rose all by yourself.",
      "The “old” trail that ascends Mount Si’s western flank offers a shorter, steeper, slightly more scenic, and if one dare say it—less crowded—route to the summit, where you can rejoin the crowds that flock to one of Snoqualmie Pass’s most popular hiking destinations.",
      "This trail is a really nice accompaniment to your morning coffee. It starts with a bridge over a very pretty little stream and is wide enough along the first part to easily accommodate two hikers side by side.",
      "This is a long plod through forest singed, scorched (and a little bit spared) by the massive Tripod Fire of 2006 to a lonely outpost in the heart of one of the Okanogan's largest roadless areas. From lofty North Twentymile Peak, with its dollop of meadows, feast on far-reaching views from the Kettle River Range all the way to the cloud-piercing guardians of the North Cascades Highway. Scan deep valleys too, including the Chewuch 1 mile directly below. Then put down the binoculars and check out the historical lookout that has sat guard on this peak since 1923.",
      "Few casual hikers venture out on this forest hike. After all, there are no grand vistas to enjoy, no thundering waterfalls, no vast fields of wildflowers. But you will find virgin forest ecosystems to explore, a pretty river valley to enjoy, and a quiet camp to relax in before turning home.",
      "You start low, strolling up a deeply forested river valley, but end up in broad meadows with stellar views of Mount Rainier. The trail gets very little hiking pressure, so you're almost certain to have the route to yourself. The trail parallels the highway, but most of the way, the road is well out of both sight and hearing of the trail. Look for weasels and martens along the river--as well as dippers and other water-loving birds.",
      "Hop aboard the Spruce Railroad Trail for a scenic and historic hike along the sparkling shores of massive Lake Crescent. For 4 nearly flat miles you'll saunter along one of Olympic National Park's most alluring natural features. Nine miles long, over 600 feet deep, and surrounded by steep ridges and peaks, Lake Crescent seems more like a fjord. With a microclimate of warmer and drier conditions than areas just a few miles away, this trail is a good hiking choice on an overcast afternoon.",
      "Stroll along the placid bay waters surrounding Bell Point, or peer down at them from the grassy and ledgy slopes of Young Hill. Better yet, combine these fine hikes that lie within San Juan Island National Historical Park's English Camp. Once a British Royal Marine garrison, the grounds are now peacefully administered by the National Park Service for resource protection and heritage preservation.",
      "Cougar Lakes boast gently sloped sandy banks, perfect for swimming and sunning after a long dusty hike. Once you've tired of swimming, spend some time foraging for ripe huckleberries--plentiful when in season--or simply scan the talus slopes below House Rock, looking for the ever-present white specks of mountain goats that balance on precarious perches high above green meadows.",
      "Well-maintained but secluded 2.3 mile loop through savannah and pine forest inside Lake Chelan State Park.",
      "Kids will love this hike because there’s so much to see: a rushing river, a lush old-growth forest dotted with wildflowers and, if you’re lucky, plenty of wildlife.",
      "This one is a jewel. A railtrail with opportunities for biking, hiking, birding, wildlife, wildflowers, river views, salmon viewing, photography, waterfall, and history. If you want an urban trail this one has it all.",
      "This trail offers vistas of the Okanogan River and Pasayten Wilderness as well as wildlife viewing potential for hikers of all experience levels.",
      "With deer, elk and an occasional black bear, this area is alive with natural beauty and life. Banana slugs, beetles and pileated woodpeckers are also common sights, so keep your eyes peeled! However, even if you don’t see any animals, this trail which used to be an old road is a perfect getaway year round.",
      "The famed Enchanted Valley chalet has been a destination for weary travelers since the early '30s, when it provided a mountain retreat for hikers and horseback riders. During World War II, the chalet served as an Aircraft Warning Station, and is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It's occasionally used as an emergency shelter and ranger station, but the precarious position over the Quinault River has caused it to be closed to hikers until it is moved.",
      "A mile-wide lahar scoured portions of the Muddy River valley, while other parts of the canyon offer you features created by eons of erosion from floods and long-forgotten mudflows. The trail takes you in and out of several small side basins, each providing a unique thrill. Some are filled with wildflowers and ferns.",
      "Explore a beautiful riverside forest, perfect for kids and adults alike.",
      "When most of Washington’s alpine lakes are still snow-covered, Packwood Lake rewards hikers with a relaxing early-season hike ideal for dusting off your boots.",
      "Walk among old-growth giants as you travel to one of Olympic National Park's best-loved waterfalls.",
      "The climb up the North Fork Trail to the Pacific Crest Trail is steep and often buggy, but vast meadows of wildflowers and alpine heaven are the well-earned reward."

      "This is a gem of a hike, providing you easy access to the best of the best of the rich L. T. Murray State Wildlife Recreation Area.",
      "This gem of an alpine lake, situated in a cirque beneath the glaciated summit of Little Devil Peak, is ringed by verdant meadows and frequented by resident wildlife.",
      "The relatively flat hike to this long, shallow lake makes an excellent destination for families with children or an easy overnight camping trip.",
      "Lake hike or river hike? How about a hike with both! Start with an exploration up the verdant Kalama River, then proceed to McBride Lake.",
      "This is an abandoned trail that heads south along Rainy Creek off of the downstream section of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Trail up to Rainy Lake. The lake is popular among fisherman, since it is home to lots of trout, but be warned -- route-finding skills are a must on this trip.",
      "Providing access to Bowan Pass, the Rainbow Lake Trail also allows hikers access to deep blue Rainbow Lake. Used mostly by backpackers, the trail lies deep within a network of other access trails.",
      "Sample the best the North Cascades has to offer—subalpine lakes, forested valleys and rugged mountain passes—on this multiday trek.",
      "This strenuous uphill climb leads to big-payout views of the San Juans from Oyster Dome before visiting tranquil Lily Lake.",
      "Enjoy a mix of solitude and company along a ridgetop with two backcountry lakes and sweeping alpine views.",
      "This strenuous trek from creek to peak offers up-close views of impressive waterfalls and far-off views of Cascade volcanoes.",
      "Escape the crowds on this two-day backpacking adventure into the less-traveled areas on the north side of Mount St. Helens.",
      "Hike along a lush green valley wall above Goat Creek in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. Because this part of the monument is so infrequently visited, it's possible you won't see another soul on the trail, meaning you'll get to have the incredible Cathedral Falls all to yourself.",
      "This self-guided interpretive trail presents grand learning experiences for youngsters and adults alike. The trail loops through the old forests and wetlands that help make Longmire such a rich natural area. It also provides great lessons in human history in the park, passing the very mineral springs that were first promoted by James Longmire in his original hotels and spa. The route even explores an old logging cabin erected in 1888 by James Longmire's son.",
      "Enjoy great views of Mount Adams from the site of a former fire lookout tower.",
      "Take a leisurely hike on an old logging road to a beautiful waterfall.",
      "Visit this large, quiet lake in the heart of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Snoqualmie is accessible both via Highway 2 and the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. From Highway 2, it's 7.3 miles to Snoqualmie Lake, and from the Middle Fork Road, it's only 8.7 miles. You can even make this a thru-hike if you can arrange a pick-up at the other end.",
      "Multnomah Falls is one of the most beautiful (and popular) in the Columbia River Gorge. And that's saying something, since the Oregon side of the Gorge flows with more than 70 cascades of varying heights. Of course, all that flowing water has made it famous, and its proximity to Portland and Vancouver mean Multnomah is one of the most crowded of these waterfalls as well.",
      "This is a loop hike that offers nice variety, including a roaring river, wildflowers, potential wildlife sightings, and human history.",
      "A peak scramble in the Snoqualmie region. Routefinding experience and climbing gear recommended.",
      "Hike along a steep-sided ravine with some highly eroded banks. Enjoy the deciduous forest with a few large trees, and appreciate the moss and ferns along the creek. There's also an option to extend your hike to include the historic district of Des Moines Beach Park, and stroll out onto the Des Moines Public Fishing Pier for the view.",
      "Hikers used to have one option on the Middle Fork Trail; cross the bridge and head upstream along the main Middle Fork Trail. Thanks to work done by WTA and Mountains to Sound Greenway, hikers can now turn right (downstream) on the fine new Pratt Connector Trail. At a junction one-quarter mile in, a boot path leads to Rainy Lake and Preacher Mountain. Just a short drive from civilization, this is a good moderate choice if you're seeking a relaxing, riverside ramble.",
      "Rampart Lakes is a pretty collection of pothole lakes with a maze of social trails lacing them together. Though doable as a day hike, it is better enjoyed as an overnight destination, with nearby Alta Mountain and Lila Lake making excellent side trips.",
      "Saunter along a pristine waterway birthed by massive icefields and glaciers in the heart of the North Cascades wilderness. Explore wide gravel banks ideal for siestas and peering up at the towering and rugged summits surrounding you. Marvel at massive cedars and their adaptive growing techniques, from hugging boulders to sprouting in riparian zones. With its mere probe into the mostly roadless North Cascades National Park, this trail will make you feel like you're miles away from civilization.",

      "A routefinding scramble to the summit of a mountain up the Middle Fork Snoqualmie. Climbing, gear, and routefinding experience required.",
      "The Middle Fork Snoqualmie River valley gives us hope. Once a wasteland of illegal trash dumping, rampant gunplay, and illicit drug manufacturing (and use), this area is now a premiere recreation destination. The Bessemer Mountain route is one of the valley's great success stories. On this old roadway built by folks eager to extract as much of the area's natural resources as possible, you'll discover that the greatest resource remains--the power of nature to heal itself. You'll explore fantastic mixed-age, diverse second-growth forests. You'll gawk at awesome views. And if you're lucky, you'll see and/or hear some of the native wildlife whose populations have rebounded.",
      "The upper section of the CCC Road is just adjacent to the Middle Fork Road. Hiking this way, you'll avoid the somewhat confusing lower section, where DNR and private property bump up against each other. Here the trail is on National Forest land, so you'll need a Northwest Forest Pass, but the 3.4 miles to the Middle Fork Campground pass through uninterrupted quiet forest, creeks, and lovely views of the nearby peaks.",
      "The Blowout Creek Trailhead offers a more secluded adventure than the CCC Road: Lower Section, despite its route along an old road. Climb a moderate grade alongside Blowout Creek for almost a mile before arriving at the CCC Road Trail, then hike to a beautiful waterfall.",
      "This hike will have weekly closures during the three-year Middle Fork Road paving project (summers 2014-2016). Learn more here - www.wta.org/middleforkupdates",
      "Lose yourself in second-growth forest as you traverse an old logging road that heads into quiet wilderness just an hour from the urban sprawl of Puget Sound. Enjoy the sounds of water rushing and birds singing. Explore mossy boulders and cross multiple burbling creeks, even do a small amount of cross-country travel on the way to the piece de resistance – a 1,200 foot waterfall that streams into tiny Lipsy Lake before draining to the Taylor River.",
      "A hike to two lakes situated in a remote hanging valley in the Entiat, this beautiful hike is ideal for adventurous backpackers in the autumn who are looking for larches.",
      "Take a short hike to a pleasant waterfall tucked away on the northeast corner of Larrabee State Park.",
      "Enjoy this easy hike through massive trees with great views of a lovely lake and an impressive lookout towering over it all.",
      "Everything that makes a river hike fun is here, cool bridges, waterfalls, big trees, lots of dripping moss, and mushrooms.",
      "Stroll first through deep forest, then up, up, and away to an alpine world flush in meadows, larches, and delectable views of stark craggy mountains spiraling to the heavens. From the pass, a broad saddle teetering on the demarcation zone between the wet west and the dry east, there are exploratory side-trip options. And while this section of the Pacific Crest Trail usually teems with fellow hikers, it's never shy of wild critters. With everything from frantic ground squirrels, to lumbering bears, to wallowing mountain goats, you'll feel like you've walked onto the set of Wild America.",
      "This 4-mile ramble from the end of the drivable road along the old ash-blasted logging road offers some of the finest views you'll find in the entire Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This makes a fabulous late-afternoon hike, as you can enjoy the setting sun behind the jagged crown of the big volcano.",
      "Lake Ann is a deserving detour from the Maple Pass loop hike or a nice and short early or late season hike in its own right. Even if you go no further than the lake, the views are rewarding and the lake quite impressive with its granite backdrop.",
      "Mount St. Helens is a peak that should be on every life list. And because it is an active volcano, it is best not to put it off for too long. Climbing to the crater rim is an opportunity to see not only amazing views in every direction, but to see geology raw, unformed and in its making.",
      "Just across the Snohomish River from the city of Everett sits a small park with two loop hike options on three miles of paved trail.",
      "This is more of a stroll than a hike . It is of historical interest with interpretive signs along the way. Beach walking is also present. Fort Casey was one of three forts chosen in 1896 to form a triangle for protection of Puget Sound. Fort Worden and Fort Flagler were the other two. All have become State Parks. Their use for coastal protection proved to be impractical so their use became a place for instruction and training of troops during both of the world wars.",
      "The quintessential Seattle walk around the perimeter of a 50,000 thousand-year-old glacial lake, this trail is accessible to folks of all ages and abilities. It continues to be a preserve for hundreds of species of trees and plants, as well as numerous birds and waterfowl.",
      "Big Finn Hill Park and the adjoining Saint Edward State Park provide more than 10 miles of trails for hiking and biking through a lush forest setting near Lake Washington.",
      "Explore a part of the King County trail system in Kent.",
      "The short half-mile interpretive trail along Deception Falls is a great stop for a quick stretch of the legs as you drive over Stevens Pass. The highlight is the tumbling, multi-tiered waterfall and its distinctive 90 degree turn the creek makes at a stop along the way.",
      "This hike starts at the North Siouxon Creek Trailhead which is also the south end of the Mitchell Peak Trail. Following the Mitchell Peak Trail for about 5.5 miles the route offers a spur down to the falls. Or for the more adventurous a steep climb up to Mitchell Peak makes for a good two day backpacking adventure.",
      "This pretty hike follows Siouxon Creek, through shady Douglas fir and red cedar forest, past several sparkling waterfalls. Start down the trail, descending to a T-junction. Turn right, heading upstream toward Siouxon Creek.",
      "This trail is part of the Forest Service network in the Siouxon roadless area and connects to the Huffman Peak Trail 129. A different trail on DNR lands ascends the Siouxon Creek from a DNR managed trailhead called the \"North Siouxon Creek Trailhead\". Technically that trail is the southern end of the Mitchell Peak Trail which leads to Black Hole Falls and beyond.",
      "This loop combines the Grandview Trail with the Soundview Trail to make 3.25 miles with some serious incline. Walk around the golf course at Chambers Creek Regional Park, and enjoy views of Chambers Bay and the vivid green grasses of the golf course.",
      "The Mima Falls Loop takes hikers through young plantings, lush forest, and quiet wetlands in Olympia's Capitol State Forest. Just 30 minutes from the state capital, this is the perfect year-round waterfall hike for after work or weekends. Hike through a working forest and examine forestry practices up close.",
      "Hikers of all ages, especially children, will love this easy loop, one of the finest nature trails in Western Washington. Plenty of birds and critters will captivate you along the way.",
      "Sheep Lake is a picturesque alpine lake guarded by jagged-edged ridges. It makes a good destination for children, especially if you let them swim, play in the meadows, or explore the small rock outcroppings. Sheep Lake is also a worthy destination for adults who want a pause from daily life to enjoy the outdoors. The campsites around the perimeter are ideal for base camping or for backpacking with children.",
      "To get panoramic views of the North Cascades without fighting the crowds at Cascade Pass or Hidden Lake Lookout, look no further than Lookout Mountain, an arduous climb that often gets overlooked by hikers heading to North Cascades National Park. From the fire lookout on the summit, enjoy 360-degree views of Mount Baker, Mount Shuksan, and a panoply of other North Cascades giants.",
      "Venture through dusty lahars, cool forest, and the high country on the shoulder of Mount St. Helens on this 12-mile loop. Do it in a day, or plan to camp along the way—this hike is both beautiful and a bit of a challenge; you’ll need a little scrambling experience to be comfortable hiking the whole thing.",
      "Hike a trail on the southwest flanks of Mount St. Helens. While mudflows and flooding rendered the land close to St. Helens difficult to negotiate even for two-legged hikers, the Blue Horse trail has been cultivated enough that the way is passable and pleasant for both horses and hikers."

      "This trail leads through small meadows, old fir forest, and huckleberry patches along the Spring Creek valley, before taking you on a moderate climb to the summit of the large, forested peak of Green Mountain.",
      "This 4880'+ West Peak of Mount Higgins, directly north of the lookout site, appears ugly and steep, but it is quite fun, though very short.",
      "This is a steep but short trail with incredible views and great wildlife viewing opportunities. The trail climbs relentlessly from the first step, first through cool forest and then finally, near the top, in open meadow.",
      "The highest summit in the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, Oval Peak does indeed look ovoid when viewed from some directions. With talus as far as the eye can see, scrambling this peak can be frustrating, but reaching the top rewards climbers with views of the craggy peaks surrounding it, including Star, Courtney, and Gray Peaks.",
      "",
      "An extension of the Lily Lake trail that leads to the Lily Lake Campsite. It's pretty uphill, but worth the view once you get there. You can get to this trail by several means: The Lily Lake/Lizard Lake Trailhead, Larry Reid/Max's Shortcut/Lily Lake route, or from the Oyster Dome trail from the West.",
      "A hike/scramble up Mt. Howard from the Snowy Creek Trailhead.",
      "The Worm Flows Climbing Route, from Marble Mountain Snow-Park, is the most direct route to the summit of Mount St. Helens during the winter season. Ice axe, crampons, and avalanche awareness are recommended on this route. Skis with climbing skins or snow shoes with cleats are also highly recommended.",
      "The Mission Ridge trail is primarily used by mountain bikes and dirt bikes, which can make for a nice, compacted trail. But by the same token, parts of the single-track can be a bit narrow and cupped, having been carved out by bikes. This can be a bit hard on the knees and ankles after awhile (especially with the additional weight of a backpack).",

From a vertigo-inducing aerie peer straight down to the deep-blue waters of one of the Olympic Peninsula's most famous landmarks. Despite its difficulty, this trail entertains its fair share of hiking neophytes and Sunday-afternoon strollers due to its proximity to the Marymere Falls Nature Trail. Aside from knocking the wind out of unconditioned hikers, this trail can be dangerous because of its exposed ledges. Keep an eye on children and avoid this trip during bad weather.",

Centerpiece to the highlands sharing its name, Tiffany hovers over a windswept world of flower-bursting meadows and delicate alpine tundra at the extreme eastern reaches of the Cascades. Once the domain of solitary sheepherders, Tiffany now hosts intrepid hikers and solitude seekers.",
      "",
      "What a workout! The Cable Line Trail on Tiger Mountain is not for the weak of heart, nor the weak of knees. A steep, slippery incline awaits you here, climbing over 2,000 feet in just 1.5 miles to the summit of West Tiger 3.",
      "The Ptarmigan Trail is the only route remaining to get to the summit of Mount St. Helens since the eruption of May 18, 1980. The trail weaves through wonderful open forests, runs along nice ridgelines, and offers incredible views over the Yale Reservoir Basin all the way to Mount Hood in Oregon and Mount Adams to the east.",
      "This hike is less an established trail to follow as a region to explore. There is a trail, but to really experience the richness of the meadows, you need to explore the areas around the trail. Move quietly and listen: Birds use this area as nesting grounds, and as places to hunt, whether it's for grass seeds, small insects, or big rodents. And yes, critters roam here too, from ground squirrels to weasels, coyotes, and cougars-as well as the ever-present black-tailed deer.",
      "No crooked smiles here: You'll be sporting a full-on Cheshire Cat toothy grin as you find yourself hiking along under the craggy summit of Snagtooth Mountain. After all, this route provides a very pleasant walk with some better-than-average views. The trail is a good choice when time is limited or weather is less than perfect. Many of the best vistas along the route are found close in to the trailhead, and they are not dependent on crystal-clear skies.",
      "Just the drive to this glorious area can be an adventure! The road is steep at times, rough in places, and sometimes totally blocked by high waters at the creek ford. However, patience and perseverance on the drive yield high payoffs on the hike. Wildlife abounds here, from flocks of mountain bluebirds to herds of elk. The lovely desert landscape is backed up by the craggy summits of the Cascades to the west and the deep, rocky cut of Yakima Canyon to the east.",
      "This route follows the Wonderland Trail east of Longmire through some of the oldest, most beautiful ancient forest left in Washington's Cascades, while providing views of the crashing waters of the milky Nisqually River. Families appreciate the nearly flat, easy trek through the trees along the first half of the route, while those with an appetite for more adventure enjoy the last half of the hike as it turns to follow the Paradise River upstream to a pair of pretty waterfalls.",
      "Desert? Well, this really is a transition zone where pines and even some fir trees cover the more protected north slopes. South slopes are a different story, however, and here you will find bare rocky talus slopes of basalt beneath towering basalt cliffs. Only a few aspens and cottonwoods grow near wet areas.",
      "Too many people think you have to be in the national park to enjoy Mount Rainier. This quaint trail dispels that myth quite effectively. It ambles easily through forest and meadow, passing pretty woodland lakes and climbing to the high vantage point once utilized by professional fire watchers. As the trail lies outside the national park, it is dog friendly.",
      "This broad, paved trail weaves through a lush forest of alpine and noble firs; these trees survived the fiery blast because of their youth and diminutive size."

      "Follow a loop trail that samples what Mount Rainier has to offer: a popular waterfall, vast expanses of wildflowers, numerous snowmelt streams, a historic monument to the mountain’s first climbers, and of course views of Mount Rainier itself.",
      "Hike on the Wonderland Trail to two waterfalls on the Paradise River.",
      "Butte Camp offers a great destination for those wanting an easy outing, or even a short overnight backpacking trip. The trail starts with grand vistas and runs through fields of wildflowers along the way. You'll experience the majesty of a native Northwest forest and the awesome power of the volcanic landscape.",
      "A short hike near the top of Taylor Mountain, just before attaining Holder Knob.",
      "A short, but rough hike to two small lakes on the eastern slope of Mount Pilchuck. The first, Bear Lake is under a half mile from the trailhead on a good trail. Once on the way to Pinnacle, however, the trail changes to a rocky, rooty, muddy mess, slow going up, and slow coming down. The reward for putting up with this mess of a trail, is a nice quiet little lake ringed by rocks and trees, usually not crowded, even on a sunny Saturday.",
      "A route-finding bushwhack to beautiful views and berries in the summertime in the North Cascades",
      "Climbing just 800 feet in 2 miles, this is one of the best trails in the South Cascades for families and kids. Not only is the going easy, but it's also a pretty hike that ends at a beautiful alpine wilderness lake. The trail follows Glacier Creek through old Douglas-fir and hemlock forest to a rock-filled basin around the cold, clear waters of Glacier Lake. Late-summer hikers find bushels of huckleberries growing along the route, and anglers can try for the big rainbow trout that lurk in the depths of the lake.",
      "Scrambling along open ridge tops draped in grass and wildflowers, hikers here easily lose the trail as it fades under the rich plant life and disappears between jumbles of rock. Further complicating things, the glorious views prevent hikers from devoting their full attention to the trail--there's just too much beauty and natural splendor to enjoy.",
      "Theses caves are long tunnels in the thick lava beds; they run roughly parallel to the surface of the land. Interpretive signs line both the trail through the forest and the tubes' mouths.",
      "Discover a pleasant alpine lake alternative to nearby, crowded Lake Ingalls. Tranquil Lake Ann can't boast the same dramatic view of jagged Mount Stuart, but it has its fair share of scenery, especially during fall when the larches around it turn to gold.",
      "Fantastic scenery notwithstanding, this route offers a great lesson in volcanic destruction and resurrection. Life has returned en masse. The recovery of this area is evident not only from the flowers, bushes, and trees that are springing up, but also by the wildlife that has returned.",
      "Waterfalls, lake, mountain views, wildflowers.",
      "Start at a beautiful mountain stream and end at a gorgeous moun-tain lake. The trail climbs moderately from start to finish, but is well maintained and stays in the cool shade of the forest. Squaw Lake is a great family destination.",
      "Views of majestic peaks and the vibrant golden hues of larches come autumn - Goat Peak Lookout offers both, as well as the commanding views you'd expect of a working fire lookout. Though steep at times, the trail's short length makes it a perfect hike to introduce kids and newer hikers to the grandeur of the Methow and North Cascades.",
      "Scenic hike that can be done in under 2 hours, with panoramic views, lush forest, wildflowers, and a historic lookout tower that ups the coolness factor.",
      "Marvel at Cedar Creek careening down a series of rapids and crashing over a twin-tiered cataract into a deep narrow chasm. On a lightly traveled trail off of the busy North Cascades Highway, Cedar Falls makes an easy early or late-season jaunt. Cruise this way just after snowmelt and witness a deafening display of hydrologic force. Pretty wildflowers lining the trail help soften the trauma.",
      "No less than five picturesque lakes, wide panoramas of South Cascades peaks and oodles of seasonal wildflowers and berries make this an ideal long day hike or weekend backpack.",
      "With a trailhead so easily accessible, there's no excuse not to visit Snoquera Falls. Best in early spring, this lush, forested trail features a pretty fantail cascade plunging down a sheer, rocky wall.",
      "At this high and lonely outpost among the craggy giants of the Chelan Mountains, views are grand and company is rare. Pugh Ridge sits smack dab in the middle of the North Fork Entiat watershed, a de facto wilderness sans motors and quite a quiet contrast to the Entiat Valley. It's a grueling grunt to the flower gardens and breathtaking belvederes of Pugh, but worth every calorie spent.",
      "Hike up a steep, dry ridgeline in the Entiat with 360 degree views of the Columbia River, the wine country of eastern Washington, and wildflowers galore.",
      "After the Tyee wildfire roared over Miners Ridge in 1994 (but spared its summit), the Forest Service abandoned this easy-to-hike, flower-studded, view-filled ridgeline hike. What a shame. The tread is still intact, the views and flowers are still there, wildlife is prolific, and people are scarce. The only prob-lem-and it's a big one-is fighting your way around hundreds of downed trees before reaching the inviting meadows that drape the ridge.",
      "Experience the rugged beauty of the Entiat mountains, rich in wild flower meadows, jagged peaks, and solitude. These trails, though occasionally steep and loose, harbor fantastic corners, wildlife, and old-school outdoorsmanship that many crowded trails now lack.",
      "Duncan Hill? At 7819 feet, Duncan is no hill. It's a bona fide reach-for-the-clouds mountain. And the views? No mere hill would be able to grant such a panoramic perspective of the Entiat and Chelan ranges, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount Stuart, the Chiwaukums, the Whites, Bonanza-you get the picture. Hill indeed!",
      "Myrtle is a quiet lake fringed with evergreens and craggy ridges. Grassy shores along its outlet encourage afternoon napping with their abundant sunshine. The destination is serene, but not so the journey. Dog- and kid-friendly during the week when motorized use is low, this hike is nevertheless a dusty slog. The warm lake waters, however, cleanse grubby legs along with disheartened dispositions.",
      "A 140-foot silvery veil of refreshing mountain water draped over shiny granite slabs and lined with stately pines, this is one of the prettiest cascades in the Cascades. And while the falls itself is a real treat, the loop trail leading to, below, and above it is sure to delight even more-especially the young set. Beautifully crafted with stone steps and bridges and adorned with attractive railings and sun-kissed benches, it's an aesthetically appealing complement to the captivating falls.",
      "The Wetlands Trail is a short (0.65 mile) trail on Tiger Mountain's Tradition Plateau. As the name suggests, it passes through some areas that often are moist and have a prolific growth of ferns. Also, it passes tiny, aptly-named Round Lake whose level fluctuates from year to year, and with the seasons.",
      "The Mercer Slough Nature Park is a 320-acre wetland populated with ferns, shrubs, flowers, several varieties of berries, distinctive wooden boardwalks and shaded pathways. Hike among the lush vegetation and wildlife, visit the Mercer Slough Environmental Education Center, tour the historic Winters House, pick blueberries at the seasonal Blueberry Farm, or canoe up the Slough Channel to experience the Park.",
      "Starting in valley-bottom meadows, you'll enjoy open country start to finish. Oh, you'll dip into stands of trees now and again, but for the most part you'll be surrounded by wildflowers, alpine grasses, and low bushes.",
      "Take your young hikers out on a half-mile trail through the swampy area north of Tradition Lake. It could even be their first hike! The trail is solidly-constructed, with good footing, no mud and it's almost all level. It's designed with the young visitors in mind. But hey, it's OK if you older folks enjoy it, too!",
      "Hike trails though sub-alpine forest and across boulder fields and, in season, enjoy a multitude of wildflowers. Pass a beautiful mountain lake. Ascend to a 5584-foot summit and enjoy incredible views of Cascade peaks and nearby lakes."

The basin that cradles Indian Bar Camp may well be the home of the best wildflower fields in the park. The main camp is on a small ridge above the meadows, though an old stone shelter in the heart of the meadow marks the location of the group camp. It's also worth noting that the single most spectacular backcountry toilet in the state is found here.",
      "Hike a gentle trail along a raging river. Perfect for evening and early morning strolls. Perfect for introducing children to the wonders of nature. Perfect for stretching your legs out on the way to Heather Meadows. Perfect for watching diving dippers and daring river kayakers. And perfect for staring into tumultuous rapids. But a terrible place for carrying on a conversation-the river's roar is deafening, its allure oh-so intoxicating.",

      "Snoqualmie Pass grows ever more developed each year. Condos go up left and right, the ski area plans new ski lifts (or replacements for existing chairs), and hotels pop up east and west. But even with the development, these are still mountains and there is still stunning mountain scenery to enjoy, even on the fringes of the developed areas. Lodge Lake stands as proof.",
      "A pair of scenic lakes is tucked in an open cirque awash in avalanche greenery and streaming with cascades that tumble down shiny rock ledges. Visit in late spring for the flowers, late summer for the berries, or late autumn for a last hiking hurrah. But no matter the season, keep your senses keen for Ursus americanus, for he's as fond of this valley as you'll soon be.",
      "Sesqualitchew Creek is a fantastic find in the middle of DuPont. Transition from urban to forest and back over a short trail that provides a great distraction from the buzz of urban life -- and all possible on your lunch break!",
      "A beautiful lake perched on the Cascade crest in the heart of the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness. Pear is a scenic delight, served with a fine accompaniment of old-growth forests, wildflower meadows, and alpine views and is indeed a sweet destination. This approach has its advantages in the form of Top Lake, Fall Mountain, and few fellow hikers.",
      "The Quartz Creek route is a river trail, but not a river valley trail. Sure, it follows the creek upstream, but it doesn't exactly parallel it. This path weaves in and out of side canyons and up and down small rises and ridges, always working upstream, but seldom coming very close to the waters of Quartz Creek. When it does dip down and access the creek, however, the views are stunning.",
      "A .3 mile, barrier-free trail through towering ancient Douglas fir and Western red cedar that is ideal for hikers of all ages and abilities. It is rated difficult for wheelchair users due to some short sections that have up to 12% grade. Most of the trail however is less than 5% grade.",
      "It's always a good sign when your trail starts in a well-named place. We start this hike at Summit Prairie, a beautiful location with a well-earned name. The trail rides the crest of the stunning Quartz Creek Ridge, running through wonderful forest and broad wildflower mea-dows. You can meander at will for 1 mile, or 5, along the ridgetop meadows as you enjoy the views down into the deep valleys of Quartz and French Creeks.",
      "Although best known for its namesake mine and the nearby aircraft wreckage, the Tubal Cain trail also offers a pleasant and scenic route to Marmot Pass, a gateway to further wanderings.",
      "A great exploratory hike to an old coal mining ghost town, with views of the underside of the Fairfax bridge.",
      "The trail to Lena Lake is a pretty, and popular, weekend destination. But hearty hikers and backpackers who venture to Upper Lena Lake will leave the crowds behind and experience a little bit of nirvana.",
      "Hiking the trail between the Narada Falls viewpoint and Reflection Lakes is pleasant enough. But you can extend the route into a loop featuring an unobstructed view of the Tatoosh Range from a rocky bluff, and an up-close experience of the awe-inspiring whitewater cascades of the Paradise River.",
      "Sometimes the crowds at Mount Rainier’s Paradise can be overwhelming. Hike the Moraine Trail to get off of asphalt paths and away from the throngs. The reward is a view down into the immense Nisqually River Valley from the very edge of its moraine.",
      "Hike through some of the Boundary Trail’s best scenery on the 44-mile lollipop loop along the Chewuch River and through majestic Cathedral Pass.",
      "This short loop trail around a quiet lake is a great place to enjoy an after-work outdoor stroll or take the kids on an easy outdoor excursion.",
      "Along a moderate trail into the glorious Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area, past burnt Ponderosa Pines, chattering mountain streams, plenteous wildflowers and tall mountain peaks, hikers will find beautiful Eightmile Lake and its rocky, tree lined shore.",
      "",
      "This one mile long wheelchair-accessible trail takes you to beautiful alpine Rainy Lake.",
      "You get both sides of the coin here: hiking through an old forest fire zone to a fire lookout site. You can see the place where men and women stood guard to try to protect the forests from fire, and you can see the effects of fire that wasn't contained.",
      "A summit scramble near Hannegan Pass in the North Cascades. Route finding experience required.",
      "",
      "A summit 5 miles into the Ptarmigan Ridge Traverse. Class 2 or 3 scramble -- equipment and expertise required.",
      "Artesian Lake and Black Lake are dry lake beds on federal land. The lakes went dry in the last century due to overgrazing typical of Eastern Washington and the lowering of the water table by local wells. Willow trees and golden currant shrubs still line the former shoreline and surface water occasionally gathers on the alkaline flats. Plenty of coyotes and birds of prey to keep you company.",
      "Connect campsites along scenic Mayfield Lake with the Ike Kinswa State Park Campground Loop.",

The approach to Breccia Peak follows the Lost Ridge trail. Heading to the top, you'll traverse a ridge and pass several alpine lakes, but you'll need to have route-finding skills and a map and compass to get there.",

Entering the large parking area at the Red Town trailhead (one of several in this 3,100-acre regional park) it’s hard to imagine that what is today a lush green forest was once a busy coalmine operation. Now all that remains are nearly forgotten place names, a few carefully preserved artifacts and caution signs warning of the hazards of travel off established trails.",

      "By late July, when the heavy mantle of snow has finally pulled away, Berkeley Park explodes in a rainbow of color. Other meadowlands around the mountain likewise boast of bright wildflower carpets, of course. But Berkeley, for some reason, seems special. Perhaps it's the north-facing bowl of the park that keeps Mount Rainier largely out of the picture, forcing you to focus on the splendor underfoot. Or perhaps it's because this park gets fewer visitors than the other broad swathes of green in the area. Regardless, Berkeley Park is a special place that's easily reached by folks looking for a moderate day hike.",

      "Follow a tumbling, churning, whitewater creek upstream as it thunders through a narrow gorge of glacier-polished rock on your way to a waterfall that drops 462 feet in three tiers. Admire numerous small waterfalls and cascades and two significant ones, all in less than two miles. This is the Comet Falls trail.",
      "The Snow Lakes trail is known mostly as the long, gradual way into the Enchantments; but it is a worthwhile - if deceptively grueling - destination in its own right. The narrow isthmus between the lakes offers a majestic view across the water to the towering heights of McClellan Peak.",
      "The trail climbs through some of the most spectacular wildflower meadows in the state, and presents some of the most wonderful views a hiker could imagine. Volcanoes loom on all sides: Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and on clear days, even Mount Hood can be seen far to the south.",
      "Climb through incredible high-mountain meadows, then scramble up a rocky peak to amazing three-volcano panoramas, and along a stark knife-edge ridge to a divide between the Packwood Lake basin and the Tieton River valley.",
      "The trail up through Jordan Basin to Goat Lake makes a wonderful outing for all hikers, but the open meadows and modest climbs are perfect for wildflower lovers and photographers. Why? Well, this route offers nearly everything you could want on an alpine ramble: vast wildflower fields, stunning panoramas that include towering glaciated peaks, high alpine meadows, cold alpine lakes, tons of birds and wildlife, and a good chance at solitude despite the incredible beauty of the route.",
      "The Ohanapecosh River may be the most picturesque stream in the park, with its crystal-clear waters, moss-laden banks, and tall forests above. One of the prettiest sections of this most attractive river is Silver Falls. This sparkling cascade tumbles over a jagged, rocky ledge, creating a noisy splash full of silver streamers and frothy white water."

From there, you can look east along the length of the canyon, across the deep bowl of Louise Lake, and down the valley flanked by Stevens Ridge and the Tatoosh Range. You'll also find wonderful views to the north.",
      "Bench and Snow lakes are found just above the head of the Stevens Canyon Road, but you'll feel like you're deep in the backcountry once you immerse yourself in the cool lakes basin. The lakes are clear and pristine, and the upper lake, Snow, is nestled in a snow-filled cirque with fabulous views up to Unicorn Peak. Bench Lake boasts a great view of Mount Rainier.",
      "This short hike leads through lush old forest to a picturesque waterfall and a cool woodland camp along a pretty forest stream. The trail lacks the panoramic views and awesome alpine scenery you'll find along so many other Mount Rainier trails. Instead, this short walk offers you a look at a different aspect of this multifaceted park.",
      "Mountains to Sound Greenway did this road to trail conversion in order to create a more sustainable, safer route for hikers to a summit on the I-90 corridor. Hike through second- and third-growth forest, pass a lovely waterfall, and enjoy a slightly less-crowded trail than the nearby Mount Si.",
      "Visit Sunrise Peak at the right time and you'll see why its name is appropriate. The early morning sun gives Mount Adams a brilliant glow that makes for an enthralling way to kick off your day. Luckily, the enchanting views that this hike offers are available from Sunrise to sunset, and if you prefer hiking in full daylight, you won't miss out on any views.",
      "Hike a short and to-the-point trail to an isolated peak on the fringe of the Olympics. Enjoy views out over glistening Puget Sound, with its ferries and Seattle skyline. But there's more. From Zion's summit follow a ridgeline trail to a series of ledges, a promised land of sweeping views of lofty Mount Townsend and the towering and jagged Gray Wolf Ridge. Make a pilgrimage in June and be rewarded with a kingdom of brilliantly blooming rhodo-dendrons.",
      "Perched on a bluff overlooking majestic Puget Sound is the unique acreage of Ebey’s Landing. In addition to the Bluff Trail, visitors can experience the seaport town of Coupeville, observe working farms, and get their fill of wildlife viewing, all in a tiny National Park on Whidbey Island.",

      "The L. T. Murray State Wildlife Recreation Area offers some of the best desert hiking in the state, and this far-eastern edge of the preserve boasts the best of the best.",
      "This popular trail parallels a thunderous creek on a gentle grade, making for an excellent springtime river romp.",
      "The Green Lantern Trail mostly follows the shores of Silver Lake in South Everett, perfect for those looking to stretch their legs and experience the outdoors without having to leave the city. With a multitude of attractions including passing through three parks with water access this trail is ready to please! Disc golfers, beach-goers, kids, birders and fishermen alike may all find something here.",
      "Hike the Hoh River to the Blue Glacier through green forest. Pass spectacular old-growth dripping with moss, nurse logs providing nourishment to full grown trees, huge cracks in the aptly named Blue Glacier, and bio-diversity seldom seen on such an easy-accessible backpacking trip. From rainforest to alpine meadow to dramatically flowing glacier, what more could you ask for in one trip?",
      "The Bellevue Botanical Garden (BBG) is a tranquil gem nestled in Wilburton Hill Park. The BBG’s winding pathways, elegant gardens and 150 foot suspension bridge provide hikers and families with a visual cornucopia and gentle refuge from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.",
      "Hike easy forest trails connecting two adjoining urban parks. Appreciate the tall deciduous trees and some large conifers, plus ferns and small creeks. In season, look for forest wildflowers. Try to identify some of the wild birds, and enjoy the antics of the squirrels that always are present.",
      "",
      "Bellevue's Ardmore Park offers two connected sections of forest habitat, traversed by easy hiking trails. Here, you can enjoy tall conifers and deciduous trees, ferns and other forest vegetation, and small creeks, giving the illusion that you are some distance away from surrounding suburbia. You are likely to find a few wildflowers blooming in season, to hear woodpeckers, crows and other birds, and see a few energetic squirrels",
      "Take some easy to moderate trails along soft terrain in a forested area home to some wildlife, mostly birds. The trails weave in and out of each other, dividing into a maze of smaller trails as they lead to creeks.",
      "With its three campgrounds, shaded picnic area, paddle-boat concession, and inviting beaches, Cascade Lake is the hub of outdoor activity in Orcas Island's sprawling Moran State Park. And an attractive trail circling the lake makes this beautiful body of water a hiker's favorite as well. While definitely one of the more popular hiking destinations within the 5200-acre park, opportunities for tranquility do exist at Cascade. Early mornings and evenings are quiet, with good prospects for observing wildlife, while winter casts an especially peaceful pall on the lake. Kids will love this hike no matter the time of year.",
      "This is a beautiful and remote hike. There is no bridge crossing over this channel, so you must bring your canoe or kayak to gain access to this trailhead. If boating's not in your repertoire, park at the visitors center and do the mile-long Art Walk trail, including a labyrinth.",
      "This loop route begins and ends near the campground at Bowl and Pitcher and includes a trip across the footbridge over the Spokane River both going and returning.",

      "It doesn’t get better than Stuart Island if you want to combine a quaint little hiking trip with sea kayaking, camping and wildlife watching.",
      "The hike involves a circumnavigation of Umatilla Rock, a narrow rock blade that passes below Dry Falls. This area lies midway along the 50-mile Grand Coulee—one of the longest and most spectacular chasms carved out by up to 100 gargantuan Ice Age floods.",
      "A nice hike to some ridgelines in Larrabee State Park. Connect to Fragrance Lake Trail, South Lost Lake Trail, Clayton Beach Trail, and Interurban Trail. This is also a very popular downhill mountain biking trail, so if you venture onto it, please keep an eye out for bikers.",
      "Follow an old mining route through quiet forest near Darrington. This trail hasn't seen much maintenance in recent years, so it may require some route-finding experience to visit.",
      "This multi-use, steep trail passes through forests and meadows, with views of the surrounding Diamond Head, Miller and Navaho Peaks, and the Enchantments, ultimately connecting with the Tronsen Ridge Trail. From here, access is also possible to Table Mountain.",
      "",
      "The Bogachiel River snakes through Washington's forgotten rain forest. No main roads run along this major Olympic river, nor penetrate its wild valley. There are no visitors centers here either. No interpretive trails or developed campgrounds amid the towering spruce and fir. There's nothing fancy here at all-just a quiet backcountry trail through pure rainforest wilderness.",
      "Hike the routes of two former logging railroads (the Iverson and the Hobart - Middle Tiger) to reach a remote section of Fifteenmile Creek. Follow a short, steep trail to connect with the Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT.) Return via the TMT and, on the way, look in on the site of a 1925 logging train wreck."

      "Alpine lakes, high ridge traverses, wildflower-filled meadows, and a stroll along the Pasayten River await hikers who elect to visit the Buckskin Ridge Trail.",
      "Hike through alpine meadows and descend into a valley following the West Fork Pasayten River.",
      "Jumbo Peak's wide, grassy slopes and seemingly endless trailside views make hikers feel like they're trekking through a storybook landscape. With huge extinct and active volcanoes in your sights, and an unbelievable bounty of flowers in the spring and huckleberries in the fall, Jumbo lives up to its name--big and impressive on a grand scale.",
      "The 3.5 mile Steam Donkey Loop Trail is an especially good choice in spring, with lots of creeklets, views of the Dosewallips River and silent forest. There is a strong chance that you will see wildlife in winter and spring. An elk herd resides in the area, and with the estuary so close, the area is rife with bird-life. As an added bonus for fall hikers, you can search for and pick chanterelle mushrooms.",
      "This trail has a brutal elevation gain in a short time, but the views from the peak of Sulphur Mountain are worth the climb.",
      "Not the easiest hike, but the reward is a hot springs if you are persistent.",
      "Follow alongside the crashing, thrashing Mad River as it snakes through a deep canyon. Wildfire stripped most of the gorge of its green cover, but remnant big trees still grace the way. And wildflowers too, including rare and showy blooms like Tweedy's lewisia. This is a perfect destination in spring, when the high country is still buried in snow, but wildflowers are blooming like mad along this trail.",
      "This trail has it all, from beautiful forests, beautiful waterfalls, good climbing and fun descents to technical sections with views of Mount Rainier from cliffs that will inspire you.",
      "In spring and early summer, the flowers are so profuse and beautiful that you would think that a gardener had planted them. And because this area is usually clear of snow long before many others in the region, hikers can attain Iron Bear Pass, the Teanaway Ridge and views of the Stuart Range and Mount Rainier while much of the Cascade Range is still snowed in.",
      "Follow an old logging road to the summit of a peak south of I-90.",
      "Climb a steep ridge high on the shoulder of Mount Angeles to a prominent pinnacle with panoramic views of the Olympic Peninsula. From this point, known as First Top, enjoy first-rate views that encompass snowy Mount Olympus all the way to salty Pillar Point on the Strait of Juan de Fuca. And gracing this heavenly haven on the mountain of angels are delightful rock gardens and fields of blooming heather. Divine, yes, but it's a devil of a climb!",
      "If you've hiked to Rattlesnake Ledges and beyond from Rattlesnake Lake, this is a delightful alternative. Thanks to the handiwork of our colleagues in the trail community, you can now reach Rattlesnake Mountain from the west, starting from a new trailhead at Snoqualmie Point.",
      "In an area of spectacular alpine lakes, Trout rates as so-so. At this lake, tucked in a wooded basin with limited views of Eightmile Mountain's craggy ridges, you won't be oohing and ahhing from its grassy shoreline. But if it's peaceful wanderings you seek, Trout won't let you down. The forest is attractive, and both Jack and Trout creeks add musical scores to it. There are some good views, too, out to Icicle Ridge, and in October stands of western larch stain the slopes bright yellow.",
      "This short trail in the Hood Canal Ranger District on the east side of the Olympics takes hikers to a relatively unknown waterfall that delivers its reward -- a captivating 130-foot plunging waterfall -- in just under a mile.",
      "Enjoy a variety of fun, funky art on the first section of trail, including many of the Sauer's carved totems and faces on trees. Climb steadily through balsamroot and lupine, as well as bluebells, and phlox for a stunning view of the Enchantments.",
      "Three beautiful backcountry lakes tucked in a hidden valley surrounded by craggy summits await at the end of this arduous hike. A boot-beaten path that leaves you beat, the Mildred Lakes Trail was forged by tenacious fishermen and masochistic hikers. An entanglement of roots, slippery rocks, and an up-and-down course that defies logic, this hike is about the destination, not the journey. But boy is the fishing good; that's what lures most visitors to these aquatic gems.",
      "Discover some of Olympic National Park's most inspired alpine scenery among the meadows, lakes, and vistas of Grand Valley.",
      "Hike through some of the nicest second-growth forest in the area, and reach the second highest summit in the Tigers. Then enjoy a superb viewpoint a short distance west of the summit.",
      "Hike through some great second-growth forest to reach the second highest summit in the Tigers. Then enjoy a superb viewpoint a short distance west of the summit.",
      "On the shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, you can walk a fine sandy beach between high bluffs and two access points to reach the Point Wilson Lighthouse at Fort Worden State Park.",
      "Roam for miles on a high ridge carpeted in a mosaic of brilliant wildflowers. Catch your breath not from climbing (although it's tough), but from watching a continuous reel of premiere showings starring glistening white Mount Olympus and deep-blue Lake Crescent. If that's not enough to slack your jaw, Mount Baker hovering over the Strait of Juan de Fuca will most certainly captivate you.",
      "From spring flowers to summer berries to fall colors to winter vistas, this trail through the Columbia Highlands has something new to offer each season of the year. In the warmer months, try the circumnavigation of Sherman Peak plus the bonus excursion out to picturesque Snow Peak cabin. Plan ahead and rent the cabin, which is reservable for $30 per night for up to six people, year-round.",
      "Wildlife is often difficult to spot in the North Cascades, but McAlester Pass is an exception to this. Take a multi-day backpack from Highway 20 into the tiny town of Stehekin, where you can rest easy and gorge yourself on treats from the renowned bakery before making the multiple mile trek out.",
      "A longer, steeper, pass free, alternative route to the summit of Mount Zion.",
      "Overlooking the east bay of Spirit Lake, this trail drops from the Harmony Falls viewpoint on gentle switchbacks. You'll be awed by the precise pattern of the fallen trees laid low by the huge blast. At the bottom of the trail are volcano-redesigned Spirit Lake and Harmony Falls. Once a beautiful high cascade, Harmony Falls was reduced in height by half.",
      "It's one of the steepest trails in Olympic National Park, a trailhead sign warns (or boasts). Over 3000 vertical feet are gained in less than 3 miles. With tight switchbacks to no switchbacks, the grade is brutal. Then once you stop climbing, you get to traverse a brushy avalanche chute. When you arrive at Wagonwheel Lake, you realize it's no chrome hubcap-just a tiny forest-ringed pond with nary a good place to soak your feet. But if you can muster some energy to climb the open ridge behind it, this hike goes to four stars, and all that sweat and pain will be worth it.",
      "An easy hike to one of the Olympic Coast's famed wilderness beaches. Walk the wide sandy beach to the foot of a waterfall tumbling from a towering bluff right into the crashing surf. Feeling more energetic? Leave the crowds behind by grunting over Taylor Point to a secluded beach flanked by steep sea stacks and flower pot islands.",
      "Located on the western edge of West Seattle, Lincoln park offers 5 miles of trails, including a loop hike with bluff and beachfront views of Puget Sound, Vashon Island, and the Olympic Mountains.",
      "Camp Long is a hidden gem, a 68-acre enclave in West Seattle featuring old growth forest, wildlife, a variety of hiking trails, rock climbing, ropes courses, camping, and environmental education.",
      "Great views await you at the summit of Bald Mountain or Cutthroat Lakes if you can stand the rough, rocky, and rooty trail that you must brave to get there. Fortunately, lots of lakes and berries keep you busy along the way, and the ever-changing surroundings on this CCC-built trail make for a great day hike along the popular Mountain Loop Highway."

      "Ray Westberg was the popular wrestling coach in Ellensburg who died in 1997 at the young age of 47. This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn't heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds--birds on the ground and in the air.",
      "Despite the name of the butte, this is a peaceful preserve for recreationists to explore.",
      "Cowen and Ravenna Parks form a contiguous urban nature area and green space, containing Ravenna Ravine and Ravenna Creek, in the middle of North Seattle. They contain 4.5 miles of trails that traverse a 0.75-mile stretch of Ravenna Ravine.",
      "Parents, take note. This simple trail offers not one, but two scenic lakes that are set a short distance from the road. A relatively flat trail, great forest and meadow environments to explore, and a pair of cool-water lakes in which to swim make this one of the more popular William O. Douglas Wilderness day hikes, especially for parents with children. The first of the twins is only about 2 miles down a moderately climbing trail, so plenty of people make their way there. The second lake is 0.5 mile farther and is worth the extra effort, if only to escape the majority of the crowds.",
      "This fine loop trail gives you scenery, mileage, and some elevation gain, with the bonus of being hikeable year-round. Start by wandering along the Wallace River as it tumbles down from the famous falls. Get your pictures of the falls, then continue your hike by including the large forested Wallace Lake. Return through a green shag carpet of moss, sword ferns and hemlock, following the North Fork Wallace River as it rushes to meet the main Wallace River and your return trail.",
      "Tucked behind Shoreline Community College is a quiet wooded area with several miles of trails woven into the forest. A babbling creek provides gentle background to an afternoon of wandering, or you can sit quietly by a lake.",
      "The Core Zone of the Enchantments may be one of the most popular destinations in Washington state, but those who venture to Lake Stuart may just get the extra-enchanting reward of relative solitude in a high traffic area. Most hikers heading into the Enchantments use the Lake Stuart trailhead, but make for the Core zone via Colchuck Lake and Aasgard Pass. However, taking the right-hand trail 2.2 miles from the trailhead leads you into an adjacent valley, with a large, shallow lake at the base of the imposing massif of Mount Stuart.",
      "The land encompassed by Dugualla State Park was acquired in 1992, when Washington State Parks bought the property to prevent it from being logged. It is now a quiet little state park at the north end of Oak Harbor.",
      "Explore ancient caves and view a wide array of wildlife, all near a large lake in Washington's Coulee Country.",
      "Hike an urban park near Bellevue through extensive old-growth forest (yes, really)! Marvel at the many large conifers and deciduous trees. View a small creek in a steep canyon. Listen for, and perhaps see, abundant bird life. And, in season, note a few wildflowers.",
      "A lengthy and difficult hike up an iconic peak inside the Enchantments. Climbing gear and expertise required.",
      "This is a road hike on Forest Service Road 5400 from the gate to the lookout on top of Slate Peak.",
      "This lightly used trail connects Robinson Pass and Slate pass.",
      "The Tucannon River--one of the richest trout streams in Washington--flows out of the Wenaha--Tucannon Wilderness Area in heart of the Blue Mountains and rolls out the wildlife-rich Tucannon canyon before emptying into the broad waters of the Snake River near Lyons Ferry. The mouth of the Tucannon is a wonderfully rich wildlife delta, and the highlands above the river provide stunning views of both river canyons, as well as wildlife viewing along the high sagelands.",
      "This hike starts out easy and gets progressively more difficult to the end--at which point the views make the whole effort worthwhile.",
      "Follow the creek as it leads from the desert to the forest. This trail starts in the Asotin Creek Wildlife Area, and then crosses into the Umatilla National Forest.",
      "WTA has worked on trails in this 552-acre conservation area to help prevent erosion. Over 7 miles of trail wind throughout the property, exploring canyons that embrace year-round springs and climbing ridge tops with views of Liberty Lake, Mount Spokane, and Saltese Flats.",
      "The rewards of this wonderful hike are pretty straightforward. You get to wander a great jeep road for 3 miles to a glorious desert waterfall. You'll have the opportunity to enjoy a side trip to the banks of picturesque Rock Creek. You'll also find amazing views of basalt mesas rising 150 to 200 feet above the surrounding landscape. In short, this is a desert journey with incredible water works.",
      "The Beezley Hills Preserve is an area of 4788 acres north of Quincy that is protected by The Nature Conservancy, which started buying up the land in 1998. From this high vantage point, hikers can peer out at the expanse of eastern Washington.",
      "Like the adjacent Northrup Canyon trek, this trail leads through a portion of the old wild forest in Grant County, a mixed forest of pine and fir that provides shelter each winter to a large population of bald eagles. Because the big, majestic eagles roost here throughout the winter, the trail--which climbs to the canyon rim, putting you at eye level with some of the prime roosting trees--is closed from November to March each year to ensure the eagles aren't disturbed during the hard winter months. Come spring, though, the trail opens up and plenty of birds are still around for you to see (and hear). The old settlers' road leads to the canyon rim with views down onto scenic Northrup Canyon and out over the Banks Lake basin.",
      "This is a loop hike created in April 2013 to provide for a new hiking experience while preserving some areas of the natural area for wildlife.",
      "Bald eagles, icons of the mossy forests and deep rivers of the Pacific Coast, flock to this desert canyon each winter, and their presence is reason to visit in late fall or winter.",
      "Waterfowl flocking to the desert? You bet--when the desert is the coulee country of eastern Washington, with its plethora of lakes nestled in the rocky basins at the bottoms of the coulees.",
      "By our estimation, and from a mature geologist's point of view, this area is equally as grand as the aptly named Grand Coulee. Geology on a mind-blowing scale can be seen here. Moses Coulee boasts towering, sheer basalt walls, intricately sculpted rock forms, and an astounding array of flora and fauna.",
      "While there is not a trail all the way around the lake proper, it’s possible to do a loop hike around this lovely little lake just across the road from Mount Erie and Sugarloaf in the Anacortes Community Forest Lands. Formerly a state park, this area was transferred to the City of Anacortes in 2002, and now the trails that loop and bend around this little lake are accessible to residents and visitors without requiring a Discover pass.",
      "A number of good trails lead out of the Salmon la Sac area, but this is one of the few that is almost completely ignored by snowmobilers and skiers, leaving it for snowshoers to explore in quiet solitude.",
      "A moderate hike up the side of Chelan Butte and across the top of the ridge promises outstanding views of the Columbia Plateau, Columbia River, Lake Chelan and surrounding areas.",
      "Take this gentle trail to a beautiful alpine lake surrounded by rocky cliffs before heading up some steeper switchbacks to a pass and junction with the iconic Pacific Crest Trail.",
      "Hike through a landscape that almost appears lunar (except for the vegetation of course). Weave in and out and even over a few of the hundreds of 4- to 6-foot mounds scattered across this Thurston County prairie.",
      "Hike an easy loop trail through a wide forested buffer zone around this lowland lake. Appreciate the many tall trees that give the illusion of being in a much more remote location, and enjoy the view from a dock from which the entire lake can be seen. In season, see a variety of waterfowl."

      "An easy, short loop hike out of the Lone Fir campground. The first bit is paved before giving way to a dirt trail that follows Early Winters Creek. After a creek crossing (log bridge) it loops back to the campground.",
      "Explore waterfalls, enjoy expansive views, and have a look at how forest rebounds from fires all along this lovely loop in the Columbia River Gorge.",
      "Hike a short, moderately steep trail to Angel's Rest, an exposed bluff with stunning views into the Columbia River Gorge. You'll be able to see the river glittering below your feet at the overlook, which seems close enough for a quick dip, but be careful, it's a long fall from the balcony.",
      "A scramble off of I-90 near Cle Elum. Route-finding experience recommended.",
      "Route finding expertise is necessary to successfully complete this hike.",
      "",
      "Unicorn Peak is the tallest in the Tatoosh Mountain Range and offers spectacular views of Mount Rainier. It's top is somewhat jagged which looks like a Unicorn's horn, hence the name. Climbing expertise and gear is required to summit Unicorn.",

      "The balcony trail is a spur off the route to Dirty Harry’s Peak. This side trail leads to a rocky overlook from which you can marvel at Mount Kent, McClellan Butte, and Mount Washington, the behemoths forming the south rim of the west entrance to Snoqualmie Pass.",
      "A good, suburban retreat for getting that outdoor fix on a busy weekend. Here you'll find casual walking with lots of extra attractions, great for families.",
      "Looking for a great day at the beach with the dog? Double Bluff is the place to be! Time it just right and at low tide you could walk for miles!",

Sure, you'll have to share the first section of the route with the hordes, but most of the casual hikers will drop out at Talapus or Olallie Lake. By pushing on, you get higher and quieter country to explore as well as a much more scenic lake basin to enjoy.",

      "Choose between a shorter or longer river walk through old-growth forest to a 250-foot cascading waterfall.",
      "This is an excellent location for folks in Wenatchee looking to get some conditioning in during the winter months, or just wanting to stretch their legs after a long day behind a desk.",
      "The Kautz Creek drainage has been ravaged by floods, decimated by fires, and rearranged by mud slides. This area offers a great lesson in the dynamic nature of a Cascades volcano. The biggest threat facing this trail is the fact that the Kautz Creek valley has been flushed by floods repeatedly over the years, with the most recent scouring being the winter 2006 flood that not only rearranged the trail but took out a section of the road.",
      "Perhaps the \"best kept secret\" among the scores of trails within the Lake Wenatchee region, this one follows along the Little Wenatchee River at a dramatic gorge. A wonderful destination for hikers of all ages and abilities, the river puts on quite a show as it tumbles and froths over rapids and beneath ledges. Amble or while away the afternoon, or combine this hike with one of the other nearby short but sweet trails.",
      "The Hummocks are massive mounds of rock, ash, and mud that were piled unceremoniously around the floor of the new Coldwater Lake valley by the mighty blow. But these aren't just piles of rubble. Some of the hummocks tower 500 feet into the air and cover a once-grand ancient forest.",
      "The Boulder Garden Loop offers an opportunity to explore stone giants on a relatively untraveled path, despite its proximity to two of the busiest hiking thoroughfares in the Snoqualmie Pass region. It also is the access route to the Old Mount Si trail, for those who desire a less peopled approach to the Puget Sound region's most well-known hike.",
      "Beautiful multi-day hike that shows off the beauty of the Hoh Rainforest. Hike on relatively level ground until the last two miles, which climb to Elk Lake Campground, a good place to start a day hike to the glacier.",
      "The Boundary Trail extends across vast sections of the landscape, but sometimes a little goes a long way. This western segment is a good introduction to the blast that altered this wild landscape.",
      "Hike along a raucous waterway into a quiet corner of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Amble aimlessly through groves of cedar, cottonwood, and towering ponderosa pines resembling pillars holding up the sky. Always within sight and sound of the crashing creek, you will find no dearth of great lounging-away-the-afternoon spots along the Chiwaukum.",
      "",
      "While the rest of Eastern Washington is still covered in ice and snow, cross the border into Idaho and descend into North America’s deepest canyon to find early wildflowers and regional history.",
      "Survey wetlands, working farms and Western-movie vistas on this 130-mile rail trail through Eastern Washington’s channeled scablands.",
      "This short hike offers something to please the geology buff and the shutterbug alike.",
      "Log some easy trail mileage by hopping on this family-friendly trail anywhere between Woodard Bay and Vail for a relaxing stroll any time of year.",
      "The nice thing about old aircraft navigation beacon sites is that they always afford a decent view. The trail to Kachess Beacon is steep much of the way, but it is easy to get to, well-shaded, and less than three miles long.",
      "Upland birds love this sprawling desert prairie. The ground-hugging birds sprint among the tufts of plants. They take refuge, and find dinner, in such glorious wildflowers as balsamroot, large-headed clover, wild onion, and canyon-bottom communities of beautiful orange globe mallow.",
      "On this hike you’ll drop down through the bluffs and walk along the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, climb to a ridge walk with panoramic views, and perhaps visit a sandstone pillar.",
      "Spencer Island is part of a larger area known as the Snohomish River Estuary and is a stop on the Washington State Great Birding Trail. The mix of saltwater from Possession Sound and fresh water from the Snohomish River create a unique ecosystem, making it one of the best birding spots in Puget Sound. On this walk, you don’t want to forget your binoculars!",
      "Explore one of the few true backcountry experiences in Eastern Washington’s channeled scablands among buttes and mesas carved by ice age floods.",
      "For being such a small area, this little corner of Riverside State Park has a great plethora of diverse landscapes. First there is the basalt rock at the mouth of Deep Creek. Further along you'll find a carpeted moss-draped forest, and then a forest that opens up to sparse ponderosa pine. There are even some impressive views thrown in on Pine Bluff, looking out to Nine Mile Reservoir, Mount Spokane and the Spokane River.",
      "In the heart of Fidalgo Island lies a natural gem of a forest with wetlands, lakes, and rocky bald meadows with great views. This nice little hike will take you around the lake on a hiker only trail. Take this hike in spring for the fresh new leaves and the dainty spring flowers, or visit on a rainy day in winter and watch the mist float above the lake among the trees. The lake is very popular on hot summer days.",
      "Silver Star mountain provides a rewarding hiking and climbing opportunity right off Highway 20. Its majestic barren rocky spires that raise out of the forested slopes seem beyond reach but in fact the summit block requires a bit of exposed scrambling, after a long hike and a glacier traverse.",
      "From Eastern Washington’s second-highest peak, the former home to Eastern Washington’s second-highest lookout, take in hundreds of square miles of rolling forested terrain, from the Canadian Purcells to the Columbia Plateau.",
      "An easy wildlife-spotting hike that can be done year-round, with views of the San Juan Islands.",
      "Billy Clapp Lake, more than 3 miles long, is a stunning body of water behind a shallow earthen dam.",
      "No trip through Pend Oreille County is complete without a stop at the county park, easily accessible for year-round recreation just off Highway 2 and a popular camping spot during the summer months.",
      "Visit a park full of coastal scenery, forests, rocky bluffs, tidepools, and a hearty climb to a 1,166-foot summit.",
      "Climb through second-growth forest to a not-so-dry creek, while enjoying spring wildflowers and views of nearby Lake Cushman and surrounding peaks.",
      "Bask in a wide variety of wildflowers—including a rare species of cactus, Simpson’s hedgehog, with its hot pink blossoms—chunks of petrified wood, and panoramic views of the Columbia Basin, under usually sunny, blue skies.",
      "A popular trail with great views of the Sauk and Skagit river valleys, Cascade mountain peaks, and on a good clear day, the Olympics and San Juan Islands. There will also be plenty of wildflowers to please photographers and hiking plant nerds alike."

      "This is more of a walk of about 200 yards, but the falls are beautiful when flowing heavily and well worth a visit when in the area.",
      "This secluded hike off I-90 follows the NW ridge through small and then large trees to the top of Humpback mountain. The summit provides great views in all directions. This is a great snowshoeing trip in the winter.",
      "Venture up a deep and dark canyon into a lonely corner of the 11,961-acre Colonel Bob Wilderness. The hike is short, but steep in places, and the terrain can be rough. But what will you receive for your sweat and toil? An excellent chance of observing a few of the wild de-nizens of this rugged rift in the Quinault Ridge. Stay alert for elk, cougar, bear, and perhaps even an endangered marbled murrelet while ex-ploring this remote part of the Quinault rain forest.",
      "Hikers from around the globe find their way to the Hoh rain forest. After all, it is world famous. But if your idea of experiencing the Olympic rain forest is sans bucketloads of people, cast your attention to the Hoh's little known South Fork. Local fly fishermen are familiar with this wild and lonely valley, but most hikers aren't. Getting to the trailhead can be confusing, but the hike is easy and not very long. The payoff is solitude.",
      "Enjoy an easy loop in the Queets River valley without having to ford the river. Saunter along an open bank above the wild Queets, hike under some of the largest spruce trees in the park, and look for resident elk while traversing old homestead farms. The Sams River Loop is ideal for introducing children to the rain forest. Unlike nature trails at the Quinault and Hoh, you'll have this entire living classroom for yourselves.",
      "This short half-mile interpretive nature loop is an excellent introduction to the Olympic's temperate rain forest. Hiking clockwise, the first 850 feet is barrier-free and accessible to individuals in wheelchairs.",
      "A short rainforest loop from the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center in Olympic National Park.",
      "Start at 200 feet above sea level and climb to a lofty, scenic peak of 4492 feet on a long, switchbacking trail through stunning old growth forest. At least that's what it was like in 2006, the last time you could safely and enjoyably hike the Colonel Bob Trail. In 2007, a huge storm blew at least three dozen enormous trees over 1.5 miles of trail. Now WTA is partnering with Olympic National Forest to saw out those trees and restore access to this trail.",
      "This primitive trail can be difficult to follow as it wanders across a broad forested bench in the heart of the Trapper Creek Wilderness.",
      "A primitive trail that climbs steeply to connect the Trapper Creek Trail (#192) to the Observation Trail (#132).",
      "There are two ways to reach Soda Peak Lakes, a beautiful sub-alpine lake in an old growth forest. This approach is from the Government Mineral Springs trailhead to the east. It's a tough hike to a serene location, with plenty of secluded camps.",
      "A beautiful rocky outcropping provides eye-popping views of Mount Adams.",
      "This trail is the first section of the Siouxon Creek Trail; it makes a great day hike and is often ignored by those planning to hike the length of the main trail. This short route parallels the access road and links the upper and lower trailheads.",
      "Indian Heaven Wilderness abounds in forest lakes, expansive meadows, craggy peaks, and majestic wilderness. Native Americans took advantage of all those offerings, and this trail lets you do the same. The lakes you'll pass along the route still hold hardy populations of trout. The meadows you'll cross offer a bounty of berries, and, for those who really want to feast at the wilderness buffet, camas root (a starchy staple of the local tribal diet for centuries).",
      "The Indian Heaven Wilderness is tiny compared to some of the wilderness preserves in Washington, but don't let its size fool you. This is a rare gem with its multitude of sparkling lakes, acres of flower-filled meadows, fields of rich berries, and herds of deer and elk. There are many ways to enter the tiny wilderness area, but from the south the most scenic access is from the top of Red Mountain, a cinder cone volcano.",
      "If you only have a single day and really want to push yourself, then check out this winter route to Indian Racetrack, in the Indian Heaven Wilderness.",
      "One of the best hiking options in the 90,000-acre Capitol State Forest, the Sherman Creek Loop travels up and down two visually appealing valleys. No grand views or grand forest here - just miles of tranquil woods and creekside walking and some historic relics from the golden age of logging. Equestrians and mountain bikers share these trails, but crowding isn't an issue. Come during the week and have this place to yourself.",
      "Come for the views: they're quite extensive, from Rainier to the Pacific. Come for the trail: it's well built, not heavily used, and it runs a high ridge for miles.",
      "Visit a park near Olympia that boasts it all: native flora and fauna, an interpretive nature trail, historical markers, and plenty to keep kids entertained all year round.",
      "Hike along a gentle grade as it climbs along Porter Creek and crosses it, traveling west on the other side, keeping the road you arrived on in view. As you reach the confluence of Porter Creek and the West Fork of Porter Creek, you also reach the waterfall, your destination.",
      "Rock Candy Mountain, at 2356 feet elevation, is the third-highest officially-named peak in the Capitol State Forest.",
      "A great sampler hike of Northeast Washington forests and the forces that shape them.",
      "The wildlife viewing throughout the Grande Ronde country is stunning. At times, wild turkeys can be seen flying (a rarity!) from one side of the canyon to the other, and they always seem to be roaming the highlands. Hungarian partridge, ruffed and blue grouse, partridge, and quail all can be found scurrying through the brush on quiet spring days. Bighorn sheep can be viewed on the canyon cliffs above the river, too, if you are fortunate.",
      "The Tucannon River Canyon is a transition zone, from the sagelands of the lower river to the dry pine forests of the Blue Mountains at the upper end of the canyon. The Tucannon is a blue-ribbon trout stream popular with anglers of all kinds. Humans, of course, fish here, but so do kingfishers, bald eagles, falcons, raccoons, black bears, and river otters. The area around the Wooten Wildlife Area straddles the prime transition zone, with high, dry bluffs and desert prairies bounded by ponderosa pine forests. Camp Wooten is a popular recreation camp used by local 4-H and other youth groups.",
      "A scenic trail in the Grand Coulee Area.",
      "This corner of the state is a very wild land and makes you feel very small in God's creation. This is one of the most remote parts of Washington, with a small human population in the immediate area but a huge population of wildlife and birds.",
      "Despite the name, Mount Misery trail offers a delightful hike to the Oregon Butte Lookout, situated on a hilltop in the remote Blue Mountains.",
      "Hike along a section of the Wenaha River in the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness.",
      "The Third Creek trail immediately plunges into dense forest. This hike drops 2000 feet along its length before intersecting the Diamond Peak Trail and parallelling Crooked Creek before reaching the Wenaha River Trail.",
      "Even without a tour guide, this interpretative trail has plenty to offer hikers who enjoy learning about local history. The trail starts next to Saint Paul's Mission, built around 1847 at the Fort Colville fur-trading site. From there it goes to an overlook of the Kettle Falls site, though the falls are now submerged beneath Lake Roosevelt."

      "Arguably the most scenic trail in the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness. Massive Ponderosa pines, giant juniper trees, and incredible views--this trail is fantastic!",
      "A lightly used trail that can be hard to follow, to the summit of a mountain in Eastern Washington that is the site of a former fire lookout.",
      "Strenuous hike out of Monte Cristo with trail conditions ranging from smooth incline to rough rock scrambles. Absolutely beautiful hike along the way and even better once you reach your destination.",
      "The McLaughlin Canyon Trail is a part of the Brigade Trail used by the Hudson's Bay Company in the early 1800's and became known as the Caribou Trail during the Gold Rush in the 1850's. Today it is an easy 3 mile round trip. There was a wildfire here in 2007, but wildflowers are just starting to take hold in this area, which makes it worth the trip in spring and summer.",
      "Take in beautiful views of Bonaparte Lake, heady pine forest, and beautiful rock gardens in this Eastern Washington escape.",
      "This short, sweet loop with spring flowers, old-growth trees and views of the Okanogan Highlands is just waiting to be explored.",
      "Amble 4 fairly easy miles alongside the delightful and wild Lost River. Follow the waterway into the Pasayten Wilderness, stopping at the base of a forbidding gorge. Here, where the river emerges from the darkness of the near-impenetrable chasm, imagine what lands lie farther upstream. But be sure to take time to appreciate the fully revealed wild country-big trees, mesmerizing rapids, and steep valley walls will not be lost on you.",
      "Burch Mountain sits in the center of a rugged region riddled with old mines. From the lofty 7782-foot summit of this former lookout site, however, you can still strike it rich in visual rewards. Gaze out over impressive crags and spires, stark vertical walls, and deep, dark notches. Peer deep into the Pasayten Wilderness and out to the prominent peaks along its periphery",
      "The route to Rock Mountain is steep, but upon reaching the summit, hikers will find a staggering array of peaks in their line of sight. Look for Cathedral Peak off in the distance as well as Haig, Bauerman Ridge, Teapot Dome, Armstrong, Arnold Mountain, Horseshoe, and Pick Peak.",
      "Nestled deep in the Pasayten, in this area hikers are few and far between, which means you get the expansive display of wildflowers all to yourself when you choose to go.",
      "A Copper Glance? Perhaps. More likely golden views of towering cliffs reflecting in deep sparkling waters are what you'll find. Little Copper Glance Lake sits in a rugged bowl of jumbled talus heaps sprinkled with deli-cate-needled larches under the reign of majestic 8000-plus-foot Isabella Ridge. An awesome sight indeed. But like the prospectors who built this trail, you must possess a tenacious spirit in order to reap this reward. The way is steep, rough, and a little bit tricky-but worth it.",
      "The Billy Goat trail is a popular access trail that allows hikers to trek deep within the Pasayten Wilderness.",
      "Experience a breathtaking section of the PCT packaged into a great dayhike.",
      "Explore 800 acres of wooded area right in Redmond’s backyard.",
      "This area won't be looked at twice by wilderness seekers in summer months, but when blanketed in snow, the narrow logging roads and gentle slopes are magically transformed into a pristine wilderness. There are no awesome views of scores of high peaks over beautiful wilderness rivers, but the scenery is lovely and very enjoyable.",
      "Although this snowshoe trek makes use of a road for much of the route's length, the way is steep, generally icy, and the upper section follows narrow, avalanche-prone hiking trails. But when conditions are good, the physical exertion needed to tromp up this steep-sloped peak is richly rewarded with stunning views of the jagged crests of a multitude of North Cascade peaks.",
      "Here's the beef on Cow Heaven. It's a steep and demanding climb through thick forest culminating in lonely alpine meadows. The cows are long gone from this former summer grazing area high above the Skagit Valley, but you can feast to your heart's content on splendid views of snowy North Cascades summits. A great conditioner and good choice for solitude, if you're feeling energetic, follow this steer-way to heaven all the way to the rocky Helen Buttes for even grander views.",
      "River Meadow's Park is a great place for a nice hike that isn't too far out of town. It's about 15 minutes outside of Arlington. There are several miles of trails to explore....some of them are along the river and some are through the meadows and forest. There are campsites and yurts available if you want to explore for a little longer.",
      "Enough bits of history along the way to keep it interesting; an old safe, mine tunnels. A little mud stomping to start off, then a wander along a couple of creek valleys with some big old trees ( that so far have managed to escape being logged). The cabin built in the late 1890's, just up hill, sits in a clear cut now. Some pine ridges part way up, and at the top views out to farmland, into Canada, and to the saltwater.",
      "The essence of this hike is history, plain and simple. Sumas Mountain is full of it from the old mining days and this hike is the best example. An old \"gold\" mine safe door stands open, an decaying ore car and a slowing filling in mine awaits you on this trail.",
      "",
      "A mix of light bushwhacking and free-and-easy rambling, Gee Point is a quick hike into some of the prettiest—and least-known—country anywhere in the Cascade Range.",
      "This hike is on private property and has been closed by the owners due to danger to hikers. No trespassing signs have been posted. Please respect their privacy.",
      "A loop hike to the base of Mount Baker or a rugged alternate route to Park Butte: take your pick. Along the way, soak in sweeping views of the North Cascades, gaze at Koma Kulshan’s glistening glaciers, munch on an inexhaustible supply of berries, and marvel at old-growth western hemlock forest.",
      "Short but steep, this trail delivers excellent views of Mount Baker, Mount Shuksan, and Anderson Butte. Similar views can be had from the road to the trailhead, but taking this hike offers solitude--even a hiker’s high--from climbing steeply away from the road and into the mountains.",
      "The family friendly trails of 670-acre Rockport State Park explore an ancient forest where dappled sunlight illuminates mossy trees and lush ferns -- perfect for a springtime stroll.",
      "Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail (PNNST) segment that runs from Alger through Squire Lake Park has a divergence to the top of \"Alger Alp\". There are two routes to it: From the North through Squires Lake Park or South from Alger-Cain Lake Road.",
      "Explore a beautiful state park near the Skagit River with an extensive trail network and beautiful campsites.",
      "This is a short, steep hill climb with great flowers in the spring.",
      "As you might expect from a former fire lookout, Sweetgrass Butte provides expansive views and carpets of wildflowers. The area provides a great respite from the hard hiking that much of the Methow Valley offers."

      "A scramble up a peak in the Sawtooth region of the North Cascades. Climbing experience strongly recommended.",
      "At the end of the Wolf Creek Trail lies a magnificently remote place: Gardner Meadows, a subalpine valley of old growth firs and myriad other plant and animal life. Once the snow melts, it is a bonanza of wildflowers and a haven for Columbian ground squirrels, birds, deer, and other animals.",
      "Ascend a cloud-snagging summit on the eastern edge of the Sawtooth Ridge, a serrated backbone of 8000-plus-foot peaks. Stare west to wind-blasted, sky-reaching rock, east to golden wheat fields crackling in the sun, and south to Lake Chelan sparkling more than 1 mile below. Come in summer for the flowers, in autumn for the larches. Come anytime for the solitude. The hike is fairly easy, but reaching the trailhead isn't. Access to North Navarre is via one of the most grueling roads this side of Bolivia.",
      "Designed for cross-country skiing, Echo Ridge also offers routes for mountain biking, family hiking, and horse use. Recreation enthusiasts are greeted with a variety of loop trails with spectacular views of Lake Chelan, the Enchantments, Pyramid Peak, and Okanogan Highlands.",
      "The Rainbow Creek trail provides day-hike diversions to visitors to the Stehekin Valley, but you'll need more than a few hours to truly appreciate the full length of the trail.",
      "A long, steady climb takes you from the Stehekin Landing to a high pass more than a mile above the surface of Lake Chelan. Those willing to complete the eight miles and 5,700 feet of climbing needed to reach the pass are rewarded with incredible views of the lake gorge, the Stehekin Valley and peaks stretching from the Cascade Pass area to the Glacier Peak Wilderness.",
      "The most prominent peak in the Stehekin Valley, McGregor Mountain offers commanding views of the valley, Lake Chelan and a wide swath of the North Cascades, in addition to a high alpine environment that is equalled by few other trails anywhere. Though long and challenging, the trail is moderate in pitch, gaining a little over 6,000 feet in elevation over a measured eight miles, until the final scramble to the summit.",
      "Lewis & Clark State Park contains one of the last intact stands of old-growth forest remaining in the Cowlitz Valley.",
      "This 22.5-mile rail trail follows the abandoned Burlington Northern grade connecting the towns of Sedro Woolley and Concrete, and can be accessed from three trailheads off of the North Cascades Highway.",
      "Here is an easy snowshoe on a wide U.S. Forest Service road with spectacular views of Chimney Rock, Coyote Ridge and, at the end, Mount Rainier.",
      "High Hut is the highlight of the Mount Tahoma Trail System. From the warmth of a cozy alpine hut, enjoy some of the best views in the southern Cascades.",
      "With gentle terrain, easy river access and views of snow-laden peaks, this narrow river valley is an inviting snowshoe destination, especially for beginners.",
      "Gingko Petrified Forest State Park presents a unique look at Central Washington's shrub–steppe. The real experience comes from exploring its backcountry.",
      "Strap on your snowshoes and explore the Marble Mountain trails with a gentle hike to June Lake in the shadow of Mount St. Helens.",
      "Following a series of winding, snow-covered forest roads, the route to Coal Pass culminates in sweeping views of Mount Baker’s glaciated northwest flank.",
      "Explore the Chehalis River between working farmland and recently restored riparian habitat. Your hosts: a bevy of birds, from barn swallows to bald eagles.",
      "Try this often-overlooked snowshoe that provides both spectacular views and solitude at the summit.",
      "If the rugged trek to Pinnacle Lake is too much, but you still want a nice hike to an alpine lake, try Bear Lake. The Pinnacle Lake trail passes Bear Lake, which makes a great destination for new hikers, or those who just want a short stroll.",
      "This is a short, easy hike through a lush forest canyon with Goat Creek cascading gently beside you all the way.",
      "Hike from behind the high school in Issaquah to connect with the Adventure Trail, the Section Line Trail, and the Poo Poo Point Trail.",
      "Hike around Tradition Lake on this beautiful, mostly flat hike. Perfect for little ones as an introduction to hiking.",
      "Hike along the abandoned Bellingham & Skagit Interurban Railway grade between Fairhaven and Bellingham, which has been reclaimed as pedestrian trail. The gentle grade makes it a good option for new hikers, and excellent views of Bellingham Bay make for great trailside distractions.",
      "Luther Burbank Park is a waterfront park at the North end of Mercer Island, offering three miles of family- and pet-friendly trails with waterfront access, wetlands, and recreational activities.",
      "Visit the remains of an old mining town in a basin surrounded by high peaks. Climb to Silver Lake nestled under the steep side of Silvertip Peak with good camping and good views of surrounding peaks.",
      "Follow a babbling brook through forests of pine and fields of dazzling wildflowers to a long-gone lookout site where the viewing still reigns supreme. Gaze out at beautiful landscapes near and far-from verdant lawns spread out directly below, to the glistening ice of Glacier Peak, to the sun-baked wheat fields of the Waterville Plateau. Heavenly? Yes. But only before the motors arrive or during the week, when chances are slim that one will come sputtering by.",
      "Hike a loop around this exceptional wetland. In season, view a variety of waterfowl. And marvel at the close-up views of beaver dams.",
      "A short but strenuous climb to a high alpine lake, buried deep in snow, is what awaits snowshoers here. The length of the trail and the steepness with which it climbs are secondary considerations, however, for snowshoers will find an inordinate amount of natural beauty and winter wilderness on this trail.",
      "Historic old wagon road at Barlow Pass. An alternative route to getting to the Monte Cristo townsite.",
      "Hike a 1.2 mile loop trail through this forest preserve. Appreciate the exceptionally tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous. Pass some swampy areas with standing water, and note the exuberant growth of ferns and hanging moss.",
      "Beautiful views, amazing wildflowers, oak woodlands, open grasslands—this short hike is the perfect way to sample the best of the Catherine Creek area. More than 90 varieties of wildflowers bloom here, making this a favorite springtime destination."

      "Set off for a hike in the Anacortes Community Forest Lands (ACFL), a 2,800-acre preserve within the city limits of Anacortes.",
      "This family-friendly educational center features a short nature trail that will take you through forests and meadows. At low-tide, you can also explore down onto the beach via path away from the center and a spiral staircase.",
      "Hike the southernmost part of the main Tiger Mountain Trail - the TMT - and return via the South Tiger Traverse to complete a loop around South Tiger Mountain, with a side trip to the south summit and, optionally, a visit to the north summit.",
      "While it’s not quite as tall as nearby Mount Erie, Sugarloaf makes a great summit—this one doesn’t have a parking lot at the top.",
      "At 1300 feet, Mount Erie marks the high point of Fidalgo Island. While it's accessible via a road, the hike up to the summit is heart-pounding, and makes an excellent outing for the day, or just a few hours.",
      "Take a short jaunt in Tolmie State Park. Great for families or just a quick stretch of the legs.",
      "Wheelchair accessible, this trail is paved to a lookout on a ledge overlooking Liberty Bell Mountain. This area is worth the trip from the west side, because of spectacular views, and the myriad hiking trails in the area.",
      "Culmback Dam and Spada Lake provide lovely retreat off Highway 2, just east of Sultan and up the Sultan Basin Road. Spada Lake is a source of drinking water, so in-water activities are prohibited, but there are hiking trails that circle the lake and nearby just waiting for your exploration.",
      "Take a long amble above an apple orchard on Badger Mountain, with loop options on the Skyline Trail, Canyon Trail, and Sagebrush Trail.",
      "A very short access trail on Cougar Mountain from the Red Town Trailhead that offers a nice graveled path, and a small waterfall.",
      "Hike through the relatively uncrowded southeast corner of a park in Seattle. Head up to the South Meadow for the views, then go down to the beaches and get up close to the West Point Lighthouse. Come back up to the park highlands for a close look at old buildings in the Fort Lawton Historic District.",
      "This is an easy loop trail, wandering nearly one mile through a forest of bigleaf maple and cedars on the shores of Carr Inlet in Gig Harbor. With less than fifty feet of elevation gain and plenty of picnic tables, it makes the a perfect destination for families with small children.",
      "",
      "Just across the road from the parking area for Fishtrap Lake (just before Fishtrap Resort) is a short access road leading to trails on some shrub grassland, a dilapidated (but photogenic) homestead, and wetlands that provide sanctuary to a wide variety of waterfowl and other wildlife.",
      "Hike the forested Iverson Railroad Trail and the little-used middle section of the main Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT). Look in on the site of a 1925 logging train wreck. Continue on to remote Custer's Bridge, and return via a loop over Middle Tiger Mountain, including views south-side hikers miss.",
      "From a historic ranger station, travel back into the early days of the Olympic National Forest. Then amble under moss-draped trees to an isolated gurgling fishing hole on the Duckabush River.",
      "Visit McKenzie to take in the wild side of Newman Lake, where one can watch for moose in the shallows along the 3,000 feet of lakeshore, or possibly see an eagle nab a fish before returning to its nest in the nearby cottonwoods. Mount Spokane and Ragged Ridge make the backdrop for this mellow loop trail system.",
      "To the base of Explorer Falls, also known as Wheeler Falls, is an easy hike up a gravel road that borders the Lake Chaplain Watershed. It is also the trailhead to Easy Pass to Echo Lake.",
      "Boulder Lake sits in a beautiful basin bounded by big trees and slopes of scree. With a delightful destination reached by a well-crafted trail, the journey is just as enchanting as the lake. Traverse view-granting open slopes, bubbling bogs, and stands of primeval cedars and hemlocks. Boulder Lake is one of the prettiest backcountry lakes on the western front of the Central Cascades, yet surprisingly few hikers venture here.",
      "Wow! That was our first reaction when we saw this desolate desert canyon. Though you'll be following an old road, this canyon seems to have been carved just for hikers.",
      "With more than 600 acres of rolling fields, pine-forested buttes and wetlands, the Slavin Conservation Area provides plenty of room to stretch legs all year-round.",
      "Hike a short, steep little-used trail deep within the Tigers. In winter, descend past ghostly leafless trees. In summer, appreciate areas of exuberant moss and greenery. And, with luck, you might have the trail all to yourself.",
      "Hike a short, very steep climbers trail to views of the Skykomish River Valley. You'll get views of Mount Index, Baring Mountain, and Gunn and Merchant Peaks in addition to one heck of a workout!",
      "",
      "",
      "The year-round, dog-friendly day hike to Fragrance Lake in the Chuckanut Recreation Area is popular with college students and faculty from Western Washington University in nearby Bellingham, and with day visitors and car campers at Larrabee State Park. On a sunny weekend afternoon you could easily lose count of the number of smiles and “hullos” you’ll exchange!",
      "Explore forest trails along Piper's Creek and adjoining ridges. Visit a Puget Sound beach and enjoy great views across the Sound to the Olympics. In the fall, observe migrating salmon in the creek."

      "The infrequently visited trail to Doe Falls is a good option for hikers preparing for summer hiking. Because of its lower elevation, this hike is snow-free earlier in the year than most in this area, allowing for a pleasant hike to a secluded waterfall early in the season.",
      "Although this trail is within Mount Rainier National Park, limited views of the big mountain are found on this route. In fact, there are few sweeping panoramic views. Fortunately, the forest is a wonderful example of mixed old-growth, with cedar, Douglas fir, hemlock, and a few bigleaf-maples tossed in for good measure.",
      "From a popular campground off of a busy highway, escape the commotion in a hidden little canyon along the Big Quilcene River, shielded from the outside world as if in deep wilderness. Enjoy the serenading river's rapids and in springtime enjoy a floral show of blossoming lilies, honeysuckle, and rhododendrons. Fallsview Canyon makes a great evening hike if camping nearby, or a nice break from the road if traveling by.",
      "Named for a Duwamish chief who led a village on Lake Union, this six-mile, mostly-paved urban loop connects pocket parks and multi-use paths around Lake Union in Seattle. If you don't stop for a bite to eat in one of the neighborhoods along the way, Gasworks Park (on the north side of the loop) and Lake Union Park (on the south side) both make great picnic spots with lake views.",
      "Are you a naturalist seeking to observe local flora and fauna? A trail runner in need of a place to train when you can’t make it to the mountains? A dog owner looking for a place to walk with your furry friend? A parent hoping to introduce a child to the wonderful outdoors? Or maybe just a busy urban dweller searching for a quick escape from the hustle and bustle of city life? If you fit any of these descriptions, then look no further. Seward Park is the place for you!",
      "This is a well-engineered trail of moderate grade that makes a 2.8-mile switchback free ascent from the intersection of the Appleton Pass Trail to the shores of green-tinted Boulder Lake. Along the way you will ramble through some great stands of fir and hemlock and pull in some panoramic views to the south including the north slopes of Mount Appleton.",
      "",
      "",
      "The trail to Appleton Pass is only 7.7 miles, but it hikes longer. The route offers some rewarding diversions along the way, but much of the payoff is in the last 1.5 miles with sweeping views as one ascends the meadows and traverses the switchbacks to Appleton Pass. Plan for an early start to your day in order to enjoy lunch, and perhaps even a restorative nap, at Appleton Pass.",

      "",
      "",
      "",
      "This is a short hike into a tree-filled gorge. Views include a waterfall, Elbo Creek, and the Quilcene River.",
      "This is an easy scramble from the saddle to the north of the much more popular Mount Townsend.",
      "Visitors to the Hamma Hamma Campground will attest to the delightful Living Legacy Interpretive Trail. The 1.5 mile trail tells the story of the Civilian Conservation Corps through interpretive signs and photographs along the way.",
      "WTA has been helping to build trails in this beautiful area near Richland. Its a great place for folks to recreate, with several trails for hiking, biking and equestrian. The views from the summit extend in every direction and include the plains of Central Washington, the Columbia and Yakima Rivers, the Tri Cities, Hanford Reach and the White Bluffs, and distant glimpses of Mt. Rainer and Mt. Adams.",
      "This little gem of a park is located in Kitsap County, at the west end of Newberry Hill Road right before the T to Seabeck Highway.",
      "Hike through a diverse forest to two alpine lakes that rest atop Manastash Ridge, one of Central Washington’s most notable geologic formations. The trail to Lost and Manastash Lakes is an underappreciated gem that will delight larch lovers, berry munchers, flower photographers, and campers alike.",
      "The hike to Camp Pleasant is often included in more lengthy backpacks or dayhikes on the Olympic Peninsula, but hikers will find an easy conditioner when they undertake this early season stroll.",
      "The Lower Lena Lake Trail doesn't offer panoramic vistas, but there is a pretty forest surrounding the route, with a nice creek basin to cross and the beautiful lake to enjoy.",
      "If you want views from Cougar Mountain, this is the trail to take--best in November through May, to avoid the summer clouds of mosquitoes. The route climbs to one of the highest points in the western Issaquah Alps, and along the way you'll find plenty of open viewpoints to take in the scenery of the central Puget Sound basin. The military early on recognized the value of these high peaks and built a missile launch and missile-command radar station atop Anti-Aircraft Peak.",
      "On a stretch of Washington coast known for its beach-driving, Griffiths-Priday State Park is a welcome respite for walkers. The natural spit features low sand dunes that are protected as a wildlife refuge bordered by Conner Creek on one side and the Copalis River on the other.",

      "An ecological gem hidden in the Wenatchee Mountains, Camas Meadows (a.k.a. Camas Land) harbors plant species found nowhere else in the world. A sprawling, lush, near-level lawn cradled by lumpy forested ridges, Camas Meadows is a geographical anomaly in the Cascades' dry extreme eastern reaches. Too fragile to explore, the meadows are best viewed from above, as experienced on this hike. Magical in spring, brilliant in fall, and quiet in winter, it's not a bad place to be in summer either.",
      "Mount Pilchuck offers several miles of gently climbing trail that follows the winding road leading to the summer trailhead parking area. Farther up the trail, adventurous snowshoers can forsake the roadway and hike up through the trees or along the wide runs of an abandoned downhill ski area.",
      "Here's a stiff climb to an old lookout site providing splendid viewing up deep, glacially cut valleys ringed by glacially carved summits. Enjoy an eagle's perspective of the West Fork Methow River, Early Winters Creek, Rattlesnake Creek, Robinson Creek, and Lost River valleys, pretty portals to rugged peaks and the Pasayten Wilderness. Melting out early, Driveway Butte makes a good spring high-country probe-great, too, for enjoying blooms. In May and June half the way bursts with showy yellow arrowleaf balsamroot.",
      "Gold Run Pass is a great picture spot and awesome lunch rest area. Also, about a quarter mile from the pass there is a new trail over to Yellow Aster Butte.",
      "An easy hike on an old railroad bed, this oft-overlooked trail serves up plenty of surprises. Travel alongside the Wild and Scenic Sauk River, admiring eagles, mergansers, and kingfishers. Watch dippers flit on river rocks. Listen to thrushes bring the surrounding forest alive in song. Pause on open banks to take in sweeping views of surrounding peaks. Marvel at ancient giant cedars. Locate relics of past logging and railroading activity. And of course enjoy the wildlife-rich wetland known as Beaver Lake.",
      "Sunrise Ridge delivers the same jaw-slacking views as Hurricane Hill, but without the asphalt and crowds. Chances are also good that on Sunrise Ridge you'll encounter some resident wildlife, especially in the morning. Deer, bear, coyote, and the ubiquitous chipmunk all make themselves at home along this delightful trail. And wildflowers-they grow in profusion, from magenta paintbrush, to spreading phlox, penstemon, lupine, bistort, and larkspur. When your nose isn't glued to the ground admiring a myriad of blossoms, your eyes will be strained from scanning the horizons.",
      "Cupped in a high cirque on snowy, craggy Mount Skokomish, Lake of the Angels in the Valley of Heaven is one of the prettiest alpine lakes in the Olympics. But reaching this divine destination first requires a passage through hell. The trail was laid out by climbers-it's brutally steep and requires use of hands in one short section going over a headwall. It's not dangerous, but hikers skittish on ledges may want to opt for another trail. For those who work hard to get to this celestial setting, expect one of the most dramatic backdrops in the Olympics as your reward.",
      "A broad, flower-filled meadow lies just to the west of this trailhead. Spend a few minutes exploring fragrant Spencer Meadow before turning south and hiking down the trail. If you arrive early in the morning, you will probably find deer, elk, or both grazing in the lush forest clearing.",
      "The trail begins with spectacular views from the trailhead; Windy Ridge is the best road-accessible vantage point in the national monument. From there it travels up and down ridges and pumice slopes onto the Plains of Abraham-broad, barren, ash-strewn meadows that are just beginning to recover from the devastation wrought by the eruption, allowing you to experience the power of an active volcano.",
      "The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 left this area was inundated with up to 600 feet of mud from the initial landslide, but today is a reminder of nature's strong ability to recover and rebuild. Elk roam the basin, browsing on the lush plant life around the small pothole lakes and ponds.",
      "The trail climbs through dry, cathedral-like old-growth pine forests, and traverses meadows of wildflowers. The trail knifes through jagged piles of basalt in massive, old lava beds, and slides under massive glaciers hug-ging the upper slopes of the mountain.",
      "The poorly named Dark Meadow is one of the bright spots of the entire Dark Divide Roadless Area. The trail passes through deep old forest, ascending modestly to high meadow-rimmed ridgelines. As the trail ascends, the views begin to develop, and the thick fir forest thins and fades away entirely when the trail enters Dark Meadow near the ridge top. The stunning meadow is filled with wildflowers, panoramic vistas, and a wide variety of wildlife. The views encompass Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Jumbo Peak just to the north.",
      "This interpretive trail loops around a broad clearing just south of Ryan Lake. It includes several steep sections, but none is longer than a few dozen yards. This is an easy, relaxing trail on which to explore a small segment of the Mount St. Helens blast area-the trailhead is just 12 miles from the volcano's crater.",
      "Sure it's a road walk, but the road has been largely reclaimed by the forest, and the destination is a view-rich summit that once held a fire lookout station. The route is easy enough that kids of all ages will be able to enjoy the walk, and when the hike is over everyone can take a cool dip in Council Lake down at the trailhead.",
      "This may be the steepest climb in the entire Dark Divide Roadless Area. It is certainly the steepest climb that is sustained for more than a few miles-you'll be huffing every step of the way up this 4-plus-mile monster, but once you top out, your worries are behind you and you can enjoy the breath-taking (!) views from this towering peak in this scenery-rich part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.",
      "A forest of thick Douglas-fir (punctuated by fat, juicy huckleberries) runs for nearly 2 miles here before it begins to thin and open up into broad, windswept meadows on the ridge top. This trail--one of the long octopus arms that comprise the wild, remote Dark Divide region of the forest-stays high and open during most of the route's remainder.",
      "A fairly short hike from the Walupt Lake Campground, through a mountainside of huckleberries, to Nannie Ridge. From the Ridge is an easy way-trail through forested parkland to the top of Nannie Peak, where a lookout once stood. From the peak, views of Mount Adams are impeccable.",
      "Set in the middle of a broad meadow and thin forest, the Chain of Lakes lie strung out like a strand of jewels in Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Sparkling blue-green waters reflect the glacier-covered north face of Mount Adams.",
      "This 2 mile ridge trail connects the Boundary Trail to the Lakes Trail, allowing for a loop hike. It is however, a very difficult route, and should only by attempted with hikers comfortable with highly exposed rock scrambling.",
      "Lake to river, this route descends through lush old forests that provide cool relief from hot summer days.",
      "This is a forest trek through ancient cedars and firs, with panoramic views of the wide Nisqually Valley and nearby peaks.",
      "This trail stays right along the edge of timber line, making it one of the most spectacular routes for snowshoers (and cross-country skiers) in Mount Rainier National Park.",
      "Snowshoers can experience this wintery wonderland at the aptly named Paradise meadows of Mount Rainier National Park. If you want an easy, family-friendly introduction to snowshoeing, there is no better route than the gentle climb through the sprawling meadows above Nisqually Glacier.",
      "This little loop explores some of the most spectacular wildflower fields on the continent. These glorious meadows of flowers are lined with trails, most of which are paved--at least along their lower reaches. This is an unfortunate but necessary fact. These high-altitude meadows are so fragile, and so popular, that the hardened trail surfaces are needed to prevent the fields from being loved to death.",
      "The Heather Lake Trail can be a wonderful route for snowshoers as it climbs just 2 miles--gaining more than 1000 feet--through thick second-growth forest to arrive at a stunningly beautiful alpine lake nestled in a deep rock cirque on the north face of Mount Pilchuck. The trail is heavily traveled in the summer, but winter visitors will find the crowds thin and the forests even more beautiful when blanketed in soft white."

      "In a park where more than a few valleys can vie for the name \"grand\", this one is the grand contender. A necklace of sparkling alpine lakes adorning bold mountain faces spans this mile-high valley. Wildflowers, old growth, alpine tundra, deer, marmots, bear-they're all here in this outdoor cathedral. Your ticket into this wild kingdom comes at minimal cost-the trail is mostly downhill on a good grade, though you do pay the piper on the way out on a grueling ascent. But it's all worth it.",
      "Countless opportunities for snowshoeing can be found in the open areas of Paradise, but heading up toward Panorama Point is the best of the bunch.",
      "The short Layser Cave interpretive trail is a quick detour off the main route south of Randle that transports visitors into the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The trail takes just a half-hour to hike and provides a nice immersion into the human history of the area.",
      "This trail was carved out of cliff faces and mountaintops. The route is long, sun-baked, and incredibly scenic, while the trail itself is rough, steep and very exposed.",
      "A long, bone-dry, and at times steep trek to a former lookout site atop Mount Jupiter, where you'll be treated to sweeping views of the Olympic eastern front, Puget Sound, Mount Rainier, and other Cascade peaks of prominence. Situated between Mount Constance and The Brothers, Jupiter also gives an eagle's-eye perspective of the Duckabush and Dosewallips Valleys, two of the Olympics' great green portals into its hinterlands. Pack plenty of water, and if the summit seems a bit out of reach, there are plenty of views to be had on bumps and knolls along the way.",
      "The key to this hike is timing. You want to hit the trail after the route is completely snow-free, but before the heat of summer bakes the trail (and any trail travelers) to a crisp. Realistically, if you hike in June or Sep-tember you'll be well served most years. Trail conditions aside, this route requires some serious stamina. It gains 4200 vertical feet in about 5 miles. The rewards are great--outstanding views, clean air, and relatively few people to share the trail with--but they come at a substantial price in lung and leg pain. Be prepared to work for every view you get.",
      "A hike with great scenery in the high country of Olympic with good opportunity to see the endemic Olympic marmot and wildflowers!",
      "This trail is threatened by lack of use as well as perpetual flooding of the Nisqually River. The flooding doesn't affect the trail itself, but it does potentially block access to the trail. In fact, the access road was lost in the 2006 floods, so before heading out, be sure to check with the ranger to make sure this route is accessible. If it is, you'll find a long climb through forests leading to stellar views.",
      "This is a trail where the journey is as interesting as the destination. Enjoy a beautiful waterfall and views of icy Winthrop Glacier. Gaze directly at Mount Rainier and witness the fascinating destruction caused by the floods of 2006. All of this is chased by the peaceful basin of Mystic Lake and surrounding meadows.",
      "The State of Alaska is a big, brash place full of larger-than-life people, places, and things. That being the case, you'd think the world's largest Alaska yellow cedar would exist in Alaska, right? Wrong. Alaska may be a land of big mountains, big bears, and big egos, but if you want big trees--especially big Alaska yellow cedars--look no further than Ipsut Creek.",
      "A scramble to Del Campo Peak from Gothic Basic. Class 3 or 4. Technical expertise required.",
      "Enjoy beautiful canyon views along this well-maintained though rocky trail to a summit at 2600 feet.",
      "Hike from a transmission line on the north side of Tiger Mountain to various trails on the mountain.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Hike into the heart of Colville's Salmo-Priest Wilderness -- so remote that even grizzly bears have been spotted here. This is high country, with some of the most impressive old growth stands this side of the Cascades. You'll experience old growth cedar, moss, ferns and wildflowers galore. But the vistas are pure Inland Northwest - vast views of the Selkirks and the Upper Priest River Valley.",
      "This year-round hike offers great views of the Columbia River Gorge along with enchanting stands of oak, cascading waterfalls, dramatic basalt outcroppings, and profuse wildflowers in the spring. Often sunny here while raining in Vancouver, it is a great place to hike while waiting for snow to melt at higher elevations.",
      "For a flat riparian ramble or a great workout to a scenic summit, Snow Mountain Ranch is a walking wonderland just outside of Yakima.",
      "Unbeknownst to many, there's a beautiful lake tucked into the forests on the west slopes of Mount Defiance. Thompson Lake provides a great destination for day hikers or overnighters in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. You may even find solitude here, just off the I-90 corridor. But that solitude comes at a price.",
      "In one trip you can traverse over five mountain passes, visit four mountain lakes and groves of larches, and experience some of the most remote edges of the Pasayten Wilderness.",
      "This “shortcut” to the Enchantments Core Zone refers only to mileage. As far as miles per hour goes, Aasgard may be one of the slowest hikes you attempt. Achieving the pass is a thigh-burning, chest-bursting, eye-popping endeavor that offers as many extraordinary views as beads of sweat that will fall from your brow as you ascend nearly 2000 feet in just three-quarters of a mile.",
      "There's nothing common about Commonwealth Basin. This deep canyon nestled in the shadows of Red Mountain and Kendall Peak offers a great opportunity to explore the wild heart of the Cascades with minimal driving and easy hiking. The trail starts just off the most heavily used highway in the Cascades, yet you'll soon find yourself caught deep in the wilderness experience as you stride into the fragrant forests, scrambling over the tumbling creeks of crystal-clear snowmelt waters and climbing through the rocky meadows in this mountain valley.",
      "A forest walk and a wetlands walk-two trails for the price of one! This wide, paved trail loops through meadows and shoreline.",
      "A scramble to the top of the main ridge that towers above the Snoqualmie Pass section of the Pacific Crest Trail. Climbing gear and expertise required.",
      "Tucked away atop Chuckanut Mountain is shallow Lost Lake. The south trail to the lake leads through a recovering forest of bigleaf maple, alder, Douglas fir, and western hemlock, meandering 4.5 miles to a riparian hideout, providing waterfalls, old growth, fall color, and year-round hiking to those who make the journey.",
      "A bushwhack to a summit between Bear Lake and Scout Lake to the south of I-90. Climbing gear and cross-country travel expertise required. Note that Bear Lake and sections of Bearscout Peak are in the Cedar River Watershed and are closed to the public. Consult a map before venturing out in order to avoid trespassing.",

      "Kids will love this route, which features a short exploration of a lush old-growth forest and leads to a pretty waterfall in a forest dell.",
      "Due to the permanent closure of the Carbon River Road, hikers can now park at the closure and venture to the end of the road to the viewpoint for Ipsut Falls. Along the way, you'll hike through magnificent old-growth forest, and many opportunities to see the power of the Carbon River.",
      "Snow Lake may be the most popular wilderness trail in the Pacific Northwest. But come winter, only a few hardy folks make the long slog though deep snow to the glorious lake basin. Part of the reason for this is that the route crosses some pretty substantial avalanche chutes, creating a danger for unwary snow travelers.",
      "Take this trail to escape the heat on summer days, or to observe how the snow brings profound quiet to the forest in the middle of winter. Regardless of season, this trail is a good introduction to the trails at Mount Spokane State Park.",
      "Spokane’s Centennial Trail started as a pedestrian- and bike-friendly route along the Spokane River, coinciding with the Washington State Centennial celebration, hence the name. Now, users can follow the Spokane River from Riverside State Park west of Spokane all the way to the Idaho border.",
      "This is a snowshoe hike that follows Corral Pass Road, starting at the intersection with highway 410.",
      "With little elevation change and a modest distance, this is a great Tiger Mountain trail for after work, especially on hot summer days. The cool forest tempers the worst summer heat wave, while the lush forests provide all the relaxation you could want. As you trek along this multiuse trail (open to horses and mountain bikes as well as hikers), keep silent and you're likely to hear the raucous calls of ravens, the screams of hawks, the chirps of juncos, and the rat-a-tat-tats of woodpeckers.",
      "A gorgeous trail accessible from Anti-Aircraft trailhead on Cougar Mountain. Enjoy wildflowers, as well as the notable \"Fantastic Erratic\" glacier boulder.",
      "The Klickitat Rail Trail is a 31-mile rails-to-trails conversion managed by Columbia Hills State Park. This linear park goes from Lyle to Warwick (on the Lyle-Centerville Highway) with several access points along the way. Swale Canyon lies on the eastern end of the trail and offers a quiet canyon, a burbly creek, wildflowers and solitude.",
      "Oregon white oak woodlands with open ridgetop meadows, wildflowers, and views of the White Salmon Valley make this a delightful hike that is off the beaten track.",
      "In Washington, trails can be found just about anywhere. This one takes off from Parking Lot F on the campus of Evergreen State College! A short hike down to a lovely little beach, this is just the ticket for students and families alike.",
      "With amenities aplenty, Priest Point Park serves a wide community of users. Take a picnic and explore its many nature trails, let your kids play on the playground, or simply relax and enjoy the surroundings.",
      "Easy trails wander through 410 acres of ponderosa pine forest jutting out into a bend of the \"Long Lake\" section of the Spokane River. Established as key wildlife habitat along the river, it's a nice little spot right outside Spokane for bird-watching. Keep your eyes peeled for nesting osprey.",
      "Mount Kit Carson Trail 160 begins at Saddle Junction and climbs a short, steep route to the summit of its namesake peak, second tallest of the main peaks within Mount Spokane State Park. While it may lack the elevation of Mount Spokane, it more than makes up for it with superior views; pack a picnic lunch and take advantage of the outstanding vista.",
      "Pass though both forest and meadow on the way to this heritage site on the aptly named Beauty Mountain within Mount Spokane State Park.",
      "Ascend via an old logging road that switchbacks up the moderate grade, offering occasional views of the Foothills of Mount Spokane to the north before entering a recovering forest.",
      "Enjoy this delightful trail in Olympic National Park. Despite a steep start, the trail is gently graded, ascending 8 miles from a valley and ending at the Hurricane Hill Trail.",
      "The Wolf Creek trail departs Hurricane Ridge and plunges 8 miles downhill to Whiskey Bend in the Elwha River Valley. It's a lovely route that gets little use along its entire length, though many people wander a couple miles down its length before heading back up.",
      "Take a steep forest hike totaling 4.2 miles round trip, or a level 0.6 mile loop along this lovely route. Either way, you can begin and end at the Elwha Campground.",
      "The forest to Mink Lake is beautiful, packed full of Queen's Cup, lilies and bunchberry flowers in bloom. Depending on the season, you may see Western Coralroot orchids and Indian Pipe, or Beargrass, Anenomes and violets around the lake.",
      "The Lover's Lane trail follows the Sol Duc river upstream, connecting Sol Duc campground, Sol Duc Falls and the resort.",
      "Washington Trails Association is working with the San Juan Preservation Trust to create and improve the trail system on this undeveloped and little-known San Juan island.",
      "WTA is helping LPO to develop a trail for refuge visitors in the 40,200 acre Little Pend Oreille Wildlife Refuge 13 miles southeast of Colville. The loop trail starts at the Refuge headquarters and heads upward gaining 600 ft to the regional views from Mill Butte.",
      "Take a leisurely stroll up the Tieton River Canyon among color-changing cottonwoods, aspens, Garry oaks and shrubby willows, all putting on one of the most spectacular autumn displays you’ll ever see.",
      "Blankets of flowers, busy critters, eastern desert country air and wide open views of the Columbia River await the eager Columbia Hills hiker."

      "The Palisades Conservation Area must have been what the Chamber of Commerce had in mind when it came up with the Spokane logo, “Near Nature, Near Perfect.” Visitors to this city park can both view wildlife and native plants in the foreground and peer out over the cityscape from the edge of the basalt cliffs.",
      "This is a long distance day hike that includes unmaintained trails. You should be an experienced route finder willing to hike trails less traveled, and prepared for a lonely hike. You may need crampons and ice axe.",
      "Venture beyond the Nordic trails to enter this hiker-only Natural Area Preserve, home to numerous wildlife species and old growth trees with outstanding views of the Spokane Valley and neighboring Idaho.",

      "A scramble up Mount Angeles just off the Klahhane Ridge hike in Olympic National Park.",
      "Located within the 197-acre Wenatchee Confluence State Park just minutes from downtown Wenatchee, the Horan Natural Area is a wonderful place to take a quiet stroll and contemplate the beauty and importance of our state's rivers. Here the wild Wenatchee River flows into the harnessed Columbia. An oasis among parched hills, Horan is also an oasis for critters amid a rapidly developing valley.",
      "Horse Lake Reserve is a 1,500 acre reserve located just west of Wenatchee. Accessing this beautiful section of the Wenatchee Foothills is done from the north end of town on Horse Lake Canyon Road. The trailhead is three miles from where the pavement ends and the climb up the well kept dirt road offers some great views.",
      "The way to Goldmyer Hot Springs is a delightful forest walk through deep woods, along the rushing Snoqualmie River, and ultimately to a beautiful privately owned hot springs tucked against the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Because it is privately owned by a non-profit, reservations are strongly recommended and are the only way to assure access to the property and hot springs.",
      "",
      "Maidenhair Falls is proof that you don’t have to hike long distances to see beautiful scenery. A mere half mile from the trailhead, this waterfall and gorge is sure to delight.",
      "Witness the destructive force and the restorative power of nature on this hike in the blast zone of Mount St. Helens’ 1980 eruption. The rocky ash and treeless areas are testaments to the devastation caused by the explosion, while wildflowers and shrubs signal the return of vegetation to the denuded landscape.",

Sylvester (see \"Sly Sylvester\" in the Lake Wenatchee section) for various acquaintances, none of whom hailed from Scotland, the surrounding boggy and meadowed high slopes do, however, bear a slight resemblance to the Scottish moors.",
      "Alpine lakes stir emotions in people, drawing them into their crystalline beauty and stunning wild settings. Most alpine lakes, though, are small affairs. Ponds, really, that can be walked around during an after-dinner stroll. Dewey, on the other hand, stands as one of the monarchs of alpine lakes. This long, broad lake boasts scores of shoreline pockets that offer up the elusive solitude often hard to find in a mountain lake basin. Stunning scenery also awaits, with tall Naches Peak towering overhead and a rich forest cradling the opposite lakeshore.",
      "A tranquil lake at the edge of the Glacier Peak Wilderness, chances are you'll have this place to yourself. The trail can be rough, overgrown, and at times steep-three good reasons for the crowd control.

But to reach this stunning scene, you too must spiral to the heavens. The trail is a climber's path, re-quiring stamina, sure footing, and the use of hands.

Neither hike is particularly difficult; they just require endurance and some good aerobic conditioning because of their lengths. No matter your destination, though, you'll have plenty of company. The North Fork Skokomish River valley has been attracting legions of hikers ever since Lieutenant O'Neil and his boys passed this way shortly after Washington became a state.",

For those who are willing to hike hungry rather than fill up on the purple trailside bounty, Hungry Mountain rewards visitors with picturesque views toward the Idaho Selkirks. Nab the peak first, and save the berries for the return to the trailhead."

Nestled between imposing St. Helens to the west, Adams to the east, and Rainier to the north, the Craggy Peak Trail boasts spectacular views of the surrounding snowy peaks. Because of some necessary bushwhacking, this is quite a difficult hike, yet is doable in a day.",

      "Acquired in three phases through Spokane County’s Conservation Futures Program, with additional funding secured through the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office, the Antoine Peak Conservation Area offers fantastic views overlooking Liberty Lake, the Spokane Valley, and north to Mount Spokane and the Selkirk Range.

      "Let the car take care of most of the climbing, then enjoy this gently contouring trail that begins in forest and passes through thickets of huckleberries before arriving in the upper grassy meadows that provide spectacular views of the surrounding peaks in the Selkirk range. Pack enough water for both you and your pup, as there are no springs after the three-quarter mile mark.",

First, the route will take you to Poo Poo Point, a knoll on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain, for the view and perhaps to see paragliders launching into the sky. Then, you'll continue via a sequence of short trails to reach and traverse all three numbered summits of West Tiger Mountain before returning to your trailhead.",

It's a pleasant stroll through the pines along the river, which is also a major salmon spawning area.",

      "Stroll manicured trails weaving through blotchy-barked madronas and stately firs along coastal bluffs, with stunning views of lofty peaks that hover over sparkling waters. Camano Island State Park offers dramatic glimpses of a less developed Puget Sound-one where shorelines aren't marred by wall-to-wall houses and one that Captain George Vancouver would perhaps still recognize.",
      "Kayak Point Park is a lovely saltwater beach park with a short trail system located along the shores of picturesque Port Susan. It's great for family outings by the shore or an easy night of camping.",
      "A trail leading from Coal Creek Falls that takes hikers even deeper into Cougar Mountain Wildland Park.",
      "For those who enjoy the challenge of Mailbox Peak-style climbing, look no further than Issaquah to find her little brother, tightly packaged in a quad-exerting, heart-jerking direct climb to West Tiger 3’s hilltop vista.",
      "The Chinook Trail #108B is a section of the Chinook Trail System, an yet-to-be-realized 300 mile bi-state loop encircling the Columbia River Gorge. The #108B section connects the Tarbell Trail to the Silver Star Trail. Many still refer to this section as the Kloochman Butte Trail and it was formerly known as the Squaw Butte Trail.",
      "A little locals trail ascending from the Methow valley floor towards Goat Wall. Trails and roads continue on up to Flagg Mountain to the south or Goat Peak's lookout 4000 feet above the valley floor.",

      "",
      "Whether you’d like a peaceful break from everyday life or just some exercise, the Salmon Creek Trail is for you. This paved trail takes you through wetlands, around ponds, and across a natural habitat undergoing restoration. Within minutes you can leave city life behind and be immersed in picture-perfect scenery accompanied by the sound of birds. The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.",
      "This family-friendly classic hike has perhaps the most photo ops per mile than any other hike in the Gorge. You can check out a natural rock arch, see a variety of terrain, take in sweeping views of the Columbia River, and enjoy early-spring wildflower displays.",
      "Sure, it's a ski area, but it's not only for powder hounds. This alpine ramble leads through steep flower-filled meadows, over narrow ridge spines, and under shady forest canopies. Views sweep over the dry, pine valleys of the eastern Cascades, the glacier-covered summit of massive Mount Rainier, and the craggy peaks of the central Norse Peak Wilderness to the north. Best of all, despite the modest level of difficulty (not too long, nor too steep) the trail isn't heavily used, so it's possible to find a quiet place for a peaceful lunch high on the ridge.",
      "A nice afternoon hike near Darrington up an abandoned road to an old mine.",
      "The Pacific Northwest Trail is a 1100-mile linear park that stretches from Glacier National Park in Montana to Cape Alava on the Pacific Ocean in the Olympic National Park.",
      "Spend a couple of hours or all day exploring a wildlife-rich estuary at the farthest reaches of fjordlike Hood Canal. Let eagles, osprey, herons, otters, and deer captivate you on this hike through grassy wetlands and along the Union River.",
      "If the long, rocky loop around the summit of Hamilton Mountain is too much, don't despair. There are alternative hikes in the area, and the trail to the twin cascades of Hardy and Rodney Falls is hands down the best option.",
      "Hike the Hay Ridge Loop on Mount Spokane to a warming hut that's a great option for a picnic in the summertime.",
      "If you're looking for the best workout in the park, you'd be hard-pressed to find something better than this, the longest trail. Circumnavigate the park's namesake peak by following trail 130 \"round-the-mountain\" for nearly 12 miles of forested trail punctuated by the occasional open meadow, or opt to turn around at any time for a shorter stroll.",
      "One of many loop hikes offered in the Mount Spokane area. Great for hiking and trail running in the summer, and snowshoeing in the winter.",
      "Trail 110 is one of the core trails within Mount Spokane State Park, beginning just inside the park entrance and providing access to numerous connector trails. Hike it as an out-and-back to learn the intersections, then explore the connecting trails to form loop routes.",
      "Moulton Falls Trail is an out-and-back hike along the Lewis River. The trail crosses a picturesque footbridge and then follows the Lewis River with the river to the right and a mossy cliff to the left. The wide hard-surfaced trail is mostly flat, making this a perfect year round hike for people of all ages.",
      "The views from the trailhead are great, and just get better for the next 1.5 miles as hikers approach the Oregon Butte Lookout as the full expanse of the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness unfolds before them in a 360 degree radius.",
      "This 165-acre conservation futures property preserves a fragment of the Peone Prairie ecosystem at the confluence of Peone Creek and Deadman Creek.",
      "This trail proves that not all hikes have to be epic outings to be enjoyable. Though short, this loop is a great learning adventure for folks of all ages. Preteen kids will especially love exploring its watery world of lakes and creeks, as well as diving deep into century-old forests.",
      "This easy walk provides some unique opportunities to view the local wildlife--Craggius rattius, better known as crag rats. These human creepy crawlers can be found hanging from their fingertips all along the rocky walls towering over the Iron Horse Trail near the Change Creek canyon. Of course, rock walls draw more than vertically oriented humans. An assortment of birds call these cliff faces home as well--swallows and swifts, hawks and falcons.",
      "Ask Washington hikers to describe their idea of \"wilderness\" and most will talk passionately about alpine lakes, towering spires of rock, glaciers, ancient forests, and deep river valleys. One of Washington's finest protected wilderness areas, though, fails to meet any of those expectations.",
      "Access to Mount Gardner has been closed by a gate and a washout.",
      "Despite its appearance in an issue of Washington Trails magazine, Cave Ridge is a hike that the Forest Service has requested hikers not attempt. Sections of the trail are on private property, and the trail is unmaintained. Excessive use and a lack of maintenance has caused the trail to slump in places, resulting in environmental damage as well as danger to hikers."

      "A steep trail to the summit of West Tiger 3.",
      "This is one of the most popular hikes along the US 2 corridor, and it's easy to understand why: a historic and active fire lookout, an enclave for mountain goats, miles of flower-blooming meadows, jaw-slacking views of Lake Wenatchee, Glacier Peak, and hundreds of other peaks. It's amazing there aren't more hikers sunning themselves on this Nason Ridge summit. And being on one of the area's first high peaks to shed its winter snows, Alpine Lookout makes for an excellent early summer adventure.",
      "Tucked in the heart of the rugged Chiwaukum Range, Larch Lake is a spectacular high-country lake flanked by rocky spires and ringed with its soft-needled namesakes. Remote and breathtakingly beautiful, getting there is quite a jaunt. It requires a slog up and over McCue Ridge and an up-and-over McCue slog again on the return. But the sweeping alpine views . . . and big, shimmering Chiwaukum Lake . . . and wide-open Ewing Basin along the way all help ease the pain.",
      "Come winter, the heavy blankets of snow turn the clearcuts into expansive meadows, and the roads into meandering trails. The north district of the trail system provides one of the easiest to reach and most scenic huts in the network.",
      "This area is a natural coulee. The sandy soil allows water to drain through soil and collect in the bottom of the coulee forming the Wahluke Branch-10 (WB-10) Wasteway. The wasteway water flows westward into the White Bluffs area. The gradual slope of this coulee has allowed the water to spread out and form several small ponds and cattail marshes. Russian olive and willow trees have been spreading rapidly, taking over some of the wetlands.",
      "This is a great hike for kids with lots to see including wild flowers, big views of Mt. Rainier and maybe even some wildlife including marmots and goats. Take a picnic and enjoy the wonderful sights along this trail.",
      "Try this early-season, ADA-accessible hike to enjoy big trees, rushing waters and glimpses of eagles, mergansers and river otters.",
      "Splendid undeveloped lakeshore and riverfront, spectacular views of towering peaks near and far, all from a pleasant loop that originates from one of Washington's busiest and best-loved state park campgrounds. But surprisingly, many campers never wander far from their fire pits and RVs, leaving these trails relatively quiet. The mosquitoes, however, are another thing. They're legendary here in May and June.",
      "River hike along Fryingpan Creek that ends with stunning views of Little Tahoma, Mount Rainier, and the Emmons Glacier and the White River. From the top of Goat Island Mountain it's a four volcano view (Rainier, Adams, Hood, Glacier Peak).",
      "A class 2 scramble up Esmerelda Peak.",
      "Followed the remnants of old logging road to the end, then head up the southwest ridge of Mt. Wow toward peak 5614, for incredible views of Mount Rainier. Class 2 or 3, climbing experience and equipment strongly recommended.",
      "This is a pleasant hike through sparse east-of-snoqualmie pine forests. Once off trail, you will be ascending alpine meadows of kinnikinnick, heather, low blueberries until you reach the talus and rocky top of the peak.",
      "Enjoy a carefree saunter under big timber along a mighty river on this easy and delightful trail. Perfect for lazy summer evenings or quiet winter days, the Skagit River Loop can be enjoyed by all hikers, from the very young to the young at heart. While away the time on a sunny gravel bar or hike all day on the adjoining paths of Newhalem's network of nature trails.",
      "Known best for the high likelihood of seeing orcas from here, Lighthouse Marine Park also offers beach access, a boardwalk, camping, and picnic areas.",
      "Venture down to a beach in a small Whatcom County park in Point Roberts.",
      "With nearly 300 acres and a mile and a half of shoreline along Boundary Bay, Lily Point Park is an excellent coastal retreat for adults and children alike.",
      "Hike up through mountain meadows to the top of Chewelah Peak, home of 49 Degrees North mountain resort, for spectacular views.",
      "A peak scramble in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Canoe Peak is a lesser summit near Lennox Mountain. Previous climbing experience and route-finding skills are recommended for Canoe Peak.",
      "Most hikers enter the Goat Rocks Wilderness from the western side, but those who come in from the east find the wilderness just as beautiful and wild, and much less crowded. The Surprise Lake Trail is one of the few that enter from the east, and it is also one of the most gentle and scenic.",
      "Spanish for Duck Island, Patos Island is a hidden gem in the San Juan Islands. This is largely because of difficulty in accessing it, but if you make the effort, you won't be sorry!",
      "This easy-to-moderate hike brings you through lush meadows, planted forest trees, and a stump-filled clearing to the monument dedicated to Robert Henry Hauberg, the founder of the Pilchuck Tree Farm. The monument meadow has great views of the valley below plus the Sound and the islands, but be aware that this is on private property and visitors must fill out a release to hike here.",
      "Mount Spokane State Park has trails for all types, and something for every season. Hike in the summertime to the relocated fire lookout atop Quartz Mountain, or explore the area in a snowy winter wonderland via cross-country skis.",
      "It's unfortunate that prior abuses of the Shoe Lake Basin have forced the area to be closed to camping, but the lake and the trails to it are pretty enough that a long day hike to the area is well worth the effort. This trail which runs along Hogback Mountain is a classic example of what most folks think of when they hear Pacific \"Crest\" Trail-a faint footpath through alpine meadows hugging the side of a knife-edged ridge.",
      "Hike to a large mountain lake close to Highway 2, close enough to major Western Washington cities to be an easy day hike.",
      "A little-known, yet spectacular waterfall, Denman Falls offers a relatively easy hike to it, if you can bear the 7.25 mile approach.",
      "Greenbank Farm was saved from becoming a housing community by partnerships with local land officials and the Trust for Public Land. Thanks to protection from Island County and the Nature Conservancy, hikers can explore the many trails that web the more than 500 acres of fields that surround the expansive property of Greenbank.",
      "Nice forested access through the Maple Valley region. Allows a hike with easy access if you don't have a car. Area serviced by bus routes (143, 168, 912). The trail has off shoots to Lake Wilderness, The Lake Wilderness Arboretum, and the Maple Valley Community Center, as well as others.",
      "Cascading waterfalls from the numerous streams and the frequent tarns located along the way make this an enjoyable hike. Mountain goats are known to frequent the area. During the late summer, ripe huckleberries can be found at the pass.",
      "With a collection of lakes, lots of vegetation, and a location nestled in the desert smack dab in the middle of the great Pacific Flyway (the route use by migratory waterfowl), it's not hard to guess where the ducks and geese are going to stop. This area draws waterfowl like a magnet, with the first great flocks arriving in mid-October and continuing through January.",
      "Follow an old road with a gentle grade to a peak overlooking the Chumstick Valley and surrounding mountains."

Today a trail bearing the name of the husband and wife responsible for mobilizing the public to protect it weaves through the impressive grove.",

Easy to reach, Lake Janus beckons its fair share of anglers and beginning backpackers, while Grizzly's bear of a distance culls all but the strongest hikers.

      "A short, steep and rough ridge-line ascent to a summit with great views up and down the Yakima River Canyon.",
      "The trail on the east side of the spit is paved and 0.8 miles one way. There are spectacular views of Mt. Baker, Twin Sisters and other peaks. Activities include beachcombing, birdwatching, and picnicking.",
      "Ocean City SP is a 170 acre camping park with almost 3000 feet of shoreline on the Pacific Ocean. Trails through the dune grasses and shore pines lead to the Pacific Ocean.",
      "From the picnic tables scattered throughout, to the brushed back trails and spacious trail head parking lot, these three connecting trail systems reflect the pride, enthusiasm and commitment of the local volunteers who created and now maintain them.",
      "A short, level hike through second growth conifers to a wide beach and a brackish estuary.",
      "This trail is the end section of Icicle River Road that is left unplowed in the winter months. It is fun for snowshoers of all ages and skill levels.",
      "",
      "Spectacular views into Alpine Lakes Wilderness, from the Teanaway backcountry and The Enchantments to the east, Mount Daniel and surrounding peaks to the north, to Snoqualmie mountain ranges to the west. As always, Mount Rainier solemnly guarding the south as always.",
      "This trail combines the serene beauty of the Little Wenatchee River valley with the thrilling vistas found on the high benches of Wenatchee Ridge.",
      "The first half of this trip is a brutally steep, brushy at times, curse-inducing slog. The second half? Absolutely breathtaking! After ascending pine-dotted knolls and traversing pumice plains and rock gardens bursting with blossoms, reach a lofty shoulder on 7526-foot Garland Peak. From this vantage high in the Entiat Mountains, prepare for visual and mental overload taking in ridges and peaks for as far as the eye can see and for as long as the mind can tally.",

      "Paralleled by a busy recreational road for much of its length, the frothing, tumbling, spectacularly beautiful Icicle Creek flows unmolested in deep wilderness at its upper reaches. The upper Icicle is more sedate than its canyon run downriver, trading heart-pounding rapids for soul-soothing ripples, steep, stark walls for lush flats of luxuriant old-growth forest, pavement for trail. A great hike for late spring, late fall, or lazy summer days, the upper Icicle invites outdoor adventurers of all levels.",

Come in late spring for showy blossoms brightening the forest floor, summer for languid lounging, or fall for berry picking amid pockets of vivid color. And with its short distance, the hike around Elizabeth is ideal for budding explorers.",
      "Past the ford, the trail climbs relentlessly, leading hikers into high alpine country where both the trailside scenery and the expansive views increase in beauty with each step forward. The path leads past a pair of pretty mountain lakes and offers some fine camping for those who want more than a single day of exploring.",
      "A brushy hike up an abandoned logging road to Jumpoff Ridge.",

Downstream will take hikers past rapids on the Spokane River, a CCC camp and a basalt bench with views. Upstream offers an intriguing peak at basalt formations. Both offer options to cross the river and create a loop trip.",
      "Start high, stay high, and enjoy the endless bounty of the wild country between the Cascade Crest and the dry, open deserts of eastern Washington. Tronsen Ridge provides a little of both worlds.",

You'll get to explore a quiet little tarn and a big sparkling lake set in a cirque at the head of the Icicle Creek valley. And most of the way is along the Pacific Crest Trail, allowing you to sample one of the most famous long-distance hiking trails in the country.",

      "Depending on the starting snow elevation, this may be a wonderful day hike in wide meadows or a long, overnight trek through forests before reaching those alpine clearings. Regardless, this route is a jewel for winter enthusiasts.",

      "The trail ascends through steeply sloped meadows into a broad wildflower basin at the head of the valley and eventually leads to a high pass on the ridge, affording awesome views of both the Cle Elum River valley and east into the Icicle Creek drainage.",

      "A barrier-free, paved hike of less than one mile from the Johnston Ridge Observatory. The trail includes interpretive kiosks and 360 views of Mount St. Helens and the surrounding blast zone.",
      "If your definition of wilderness includes remote wildlands untouched by the hands of man, this is a misnamed peak. But if you can accept that wilderness includes lands returned to a state of wildness, you'll love this simple little Cougar Mountain hike in a natural wonderland that's just minutes from an urban jungle. Though the trail is usually hikeable year-round (snowfall is scarce at this elevation), the route is best enjoyed in the fall through spring because mosquitoes buzz here in great numbers during the summer.",
      "Hike through an old-growth Sitka spruce forest just minutes from the mill town of Raymond. Butte Creek's magnificent ancient grove of trees is a small remnant of the grand forests that once covered the surrounding Willapa Hills.",
      "Rising above the pastoral farmlands of the North Fork Stillaguamish River valley between Arlington and Darrington is impressive Mount Higgins, with its folded strata of metamorphosed sandstone and shale. It's as if Atlas himself crunched this landscape into a giant accordion. Hum a Cajun tune or two and two-step up the steep trail to the vertigo-inducing former lookout site, where you can peer straight down to the Stilly or out across to rows of jagged and glacier-clad peaks. Chances are you'll have this airy outpost all to yourself.",
      "When you want to simply stretch your legs and enjoy the woods, this is the trail to explore. The summit of Middle Tiger is wooded, so you won't find grand views. In fact, the entire route is wooded. But that's okay. This area is rich with wildlife, from the winged variety (woodpeckers, flickers, red-tailed hawks, Stellar's jays) to the four-legged kind (deer, bobcats, black bears, cougars, martens, coyotes, raccoons, beavers). There are also the usual suspects when it comes to forest flora--with a variety of trees, bushes, wildflowers, ferns, and mosses--and the usual suspects in summer when it comes to mosquitoes, so visit in fall through spring for swat-free hiking."

      "Follow Tiger Mountain's finest old rail line while exploring some of the wildest and remotest stands of forest remaining on the mountain. You'll even find some outstanding views during this long, gentle hike. If you want to keep from swatting mosquitoes with every step, visit in fall through spring.",
      "You'll want to visit this Tiger Mountain swamp during the wet season to really enjoy all it has to offer - July and August can be uncomfortably hot and prime time for mosquitoes. Plus, if you head out during the winter waterfowl migration, you might find a rare treat: wood ducks in the marshy areas. But any time of year can be an adventure here, with a bounty of wild plants and animals to enjoy",
      "The broad, deep chasm of Washtucna Coulee cuts through the sagebrush flats of the Snake River plateau country, providing a wonderful expose of the power of the Great Missoula Floods that carved Washington's coulees after the last great Ice Age.",
      "This is a low-elevation route, so the best time to strap on snowshoes for a walk on Segelsen Ridge is in midwinter when the snow is at its deepest. Although better snow is oftentimes found elsewhere, this popular ridge hike offers great views without a long drive on mountain roads.",
      "Hike through some of the last standing old-growth trees in the Chehalis Valley. Admire trails, bridges, and structures built by the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Once finished hiking, sit by a small cascade and let it lull you to rest.",
      "Two 2-mile loops in a 237-acre state park not too far from downtown Montesano. Enjoy an easy hike through mature forest along a sliver of a lake teeming with fish and birdlife. T",
      "Snowshoers who like to climb will love this route. Although the trail is broad and easy to follow all the way to the ridge crest, ample opportunities exist for snowshoers who want to show off their climbing abilities by heading straight up the open slopes.",
      "This 1.1-mile trail parallels Hardy Creek as one segment of the Hamilton Mountain loop. It is high up the ridge above the creek, traversing red alder and Douglas-fir forests.",
      "When you want solitude and serenity without a lot of uphill effort, the Haney Meadow Loop is a great option.",
      "This is a winter scramble up a ruthlessly steep trail, but the views and the scenery along the way are unmatched. The route climbs quickly up a steep ridgeline on a narrow hiking trail, and snowshoers won't find much to look for in the first mile as they struggle up the slope.",
      "Today the \"geyser\" is a flame several inches tall in a rock-rimmed basin. Despite the misnomer, however, Flaming Geyser State Park sports some impressive features, including miles of trail through wonderful forest and along a gorgeous river.",
      "This 23-mile scenic corridor currently passes through the heart of the wildlife-rich Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge. The route offers opportunities to see interpretive panels, numerous wildlife species, and associated scenic landscapes. Trail signage indicates key features along the trail, as well as mile markers with numbers referencing the distance from Portland, Oregon, as established by the Spokane--Portland--Seattle Railroad in the early 1900s.",
      "The Worm Flows, long rippling lava flows from an eruption eons ago, roll down the southeast flank of Mount St. Helens creating a remarkably unique environment.",
      "Snowshoers can explore its flanks and summit by trekking up the eastern side. Along the way, you'll enjoy ample opportunities to experience wildlife, and some glorious views of the Snoqualmie Pass peaks.",
      "This is a pleasant forest walk, offering a fairly easy outing for the family. The route holds to a broad, easy-to-follow road for the first 1.5 miles before dropping into the woods to ramble along a narrow hiking path.",
      "The route to the top of Sun Top is often groomed for cross-country skiers, but snowshoers will still enjoy this trek. After all, the views are just as spectacular, and the winter landscape just as pretty, even when the trail has been leveled for skiers.",
      "The Blewett Pass area may be one of the finest snow recreation spots in the state, with trails set aside for motorized and nonmotorized recreation.",
      "A delightful hike any time of year, Spencer Spit is a dynamic environment always in flux. Amble along this protruding point in Lopez Sound watching for playful seals, probing shorebirds, surf-riding waterfowl, and majestic eagles hovering above. The hike is short, but you'll want to linger long, for Spencer Spit is one of the finest beaches in the San Juans.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Fairy-tale roaming! For day hiking, roam and turn around when you feel like it – but you will want to keep hiking! Wide open views, flower show, ponderosas, wildlife. The trail is well maintained and an easy grade with plenty of rocky outcroppings to stop and rest at, take in the views and enjoy the flower show.",
      "The land that comprises Sun Lakes State Park was purchased over the years in fifteen pieces. The last big chunk was obtained by the state in 1972, when it was bought from the Bureau of Land Management. The desert- and lake-filled park now encompasses more than 4000 acres in and around Grand Coulee. Park Lake is the largest of the lakes in the park, and this trail climbs a picturesque canyon along the lake's eastern flank, providing stunning views of the park.",

You'll also find an array of birds and animals--swallows, swifts, bluebirds, chukars, quails, magpies, partridges, hawks, and eagles grace the sky while deer, elk, bighorn sheep, coyotes, rock chucks (marmots), badgers, hares, and an army of other small mammals roam the desert floor.",
      "A nice creekside hike within the Olympics with the option to check out Marymere Falls on the hike. This hike has all types of old growth and lush vegetation.",
      "This peak stands apart from other mountains in the area and therefore offers great unobstructed views in all directions. The Forest Service used to maintain a fire lookout station at the summit, and it's easy to see why. The views of the Wind River valley and the southern Washington Cascades are fantastic.",
      "Mountain rivers are magical, crystal-clear ribbons that inundate your senses. They can be cool massages for your feet. They offer delicate music for your eyes, sparkling flashes in the alpine sunlight. When properly treated, they offer needed refreshment for thirsty hikers.",

      "Sweet Caroline, set high in a hidden basin between 7996-foot Eightmile Mountain and 8501-foot Cashmere Mountain, will no doubt have you singing (Neil Diamond or other) tunes from its peaceful shoreline. But you'll probably be muttering some not-so-sweet things as you toil up the steep and hot trail to reach it. There's a reason why Lake Caroline receives only a fraction of the visitors that the nearby alpine lakes do. Such is the price for solitude in the land of the Enchantments.",

      "Massive old trees, both standing and dead, are the key features of this interpretive loop hike. The ancient forest stands as a living cathedral, while the fallen old trees have become givers of new life. The large old logs on the ground that serve as nurseries to new trees are known as nurse logs. The trail weaves through this lush ecosys-tem, offering a cool walk on a hot summer day, with plenty of oppor-tunities not only to exercise the kids but to give them a few lessons in forest ecosystems along the way.",
      "This forgotten trail suffers from neglect in the form of disuse. Too many hikers ignored the short trail up the canyon wall above the Lewis River, and the land managers have taken notice, it seems. The path provides a pleasant walk in the woods, but it is getting rough and brushy. It would be great to see these small remnant trails restored for day hikers to enjoy. In the meantime, it's rough but still enjoyable as a place to explore the recuperative power of nature. The forest is young and regrowing, and the wildlife is flocking back."

This trail, though open to motors, offers hikers a rewarding excursion up a beautiful mountain in one of the most stunning parts of the Cascades, and Elbow Peak provides grand views and glorious wildflower-viewing opportunities.",
      "Forest Lake may be the most underappreciated lake within Mount Rainier National Park. You won't find grand views. It's not in a broad, sun-filled meadow. There is minimal camping space available and not a lot of potential for extending the relatively short mileage. Many hikers see those as negatives. Perfect! Because that means there's a much higher likelihood that you and I can enjoy this wonderful route in relaxing solitude.

But the expanse of open public lands that surround this massive butte harbors some of the best desert ecosystems in the area. Selah stands on the eastern edge of the Yakima River Canyon, offering amazing views of the canyon and the sheer wall of the Yakima Rim.",
      "Bring the kids, and the dog. This short trail allows ample time to explore the local forest ecology before it presents you with grand views of the oft-forgotten Clearwater Wilderness and the surrounding country. The trail climbs gradually, making it suitable for short legs and old-timers. It's a bird-watchers paradise, too, since it starts in a clear-cut, runs through forest, and opens onto clearings. Birds love the variety of ecosystems, which provide both cover (forest) and food (in the clear-cuts and clearings).",
      "Kids, as well as parents, love this short hike since it's just long enough to tire out young legs without being too tiring--you can set aside your worries about having to tote your tot back to the trailhead.",
      "You'll climb in a long, steady push over the course of this 3-mile trail. No switchbacks, few turns, just a straight out and back to the South Peak of French Cabin Mountain--dropping briefly, then climbing steeply again to skirt just below the lower North Peak on the way.",
      "A nice forested stroll, with views of a small creek, and the valley below.",
      "Hike through a forest of madronas and Doug-firs to a long sandy beach with impressive views of Mount Rainier towering in the distance. Walk out on a narrow spit. Explore a lagoon flourishing with birds. Watch playful seals ply harbor waters or comb the shoreline of this delightful maritime park. Jefferson County's South Indian Island Park is one of the best-kept secrets on the Olympic Peninsula.",

      "There aren't many examples of temperate rain forest left standing in the southern Cascades. Most of these moss-laden cathedral forests are found on the Olympic Peninsula or along the Coastal Range of Oregon. To be sure, there are old-growth forest stands throughout the Cascades, but very few are of the rain-forest variety. Here is one of those last remnants of the ancient lowland rain forests.",
      "For the most scenic lower part of the creek, the trail stays well above the creek.",
      "Seldom visited but deserving of more attention, this route rolls past a couple of sparkling waterfalls, climbs through lush old forest, and leads to moderate views from a wooded pass above a pretty wooded lake basin. The trail is on the maintenance logs, but the relatively light use leaves the route brushy and the trail tread rough at times. The best favor we can do for this sweet little forest route is to use it: the path needs people to use it and love it. It offers a great outing in a part of the park seldom visited by the hordes that descend on the big mountain each year.",
      "This area is a natural coulee. The sandy soil allows water to drain through soil and collect in the bottom of the coulee forming the Wahluke Branch-10 (WB-10) Wasteway. The wasteway water flows westward into the White Bluffs area.",
      "Douglas Creek carves through the bottom of a deep, foliage-rich canyon in the heart of Washington's central plains. The views of the deep canyon are spectacular, and the stark rock walls and structures provide fascinating lessons in geology.",
      "Thick second-growth forest lines this route, with occasional old-growth trees poking through the low, thick canopy. The trail follows along the boundary of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, with private forestlands to the east.",
      "With trails like this, it is nearly impossible to forget that this entire region was shaped and built by volcanic activity. This little cinder cone is a wonderful place to explore and to enjoy some beautiful views from the top of the butte.",
      "The Jackpine Shelter Interpretive Trail explores an old forest and its interaction with the surrounding volcanic environment. Despite the Mount St. Helens catastrophe of May 18, 1980, this beautiful, ancient forest grove remains wonderfully intact.",
      "A quiet trail from a popular campground along a rainforest river lined with giant spruce. Hike this trail early in the morning or late in the evening for wildlife- and bird-watching. The Quillayute River is famous for its steelhead and salmon fishing, so you may want to consider bringing your fishing pole along as well.",
      "The desert here appears to be carpeted with flowers come spring! The most common colorful ground cover includes numerous species of phlox, adding the colors of white, pink, and creamy yellow to the hills. Both Hooker's and Carey's balsamroot add brilliant golds and greens, and microsensis adds a shiny yellow to the tapestry.",
      "This area north of Odessa is dotted with geological oddities: craters left in the aftermath of the Great Missoula Floods. The craters range in appearance from a simple deep hole in the ground to a vast depression a quarter mile around--looking almost look like a meteor might have glanced across the steppe landscape.",
      "An old wooden stable, crowned by a rusted sheet-iron roof, stands at the trailhead on Escure Ranch. Several other old buildings remain among the collection of barns and outbuildings that mark the historic headquarters of the now-defunct ranch. Corrals and fences divide the grounds of the headquarters into a patchwork of small yards. This wonderful old ranch setting creates an Old West feel that lingers throughout a hike. Beyond the buildings, you'll find black basalt mesas dotting the landscape around lakes, and many of these sheer-sided buttes can be seen reflected in the lake waters.",
      "Great views await you here, as well as a total desert experience--complete with rattlesnakes.",
      "The old Milwaukee road railway slices eastward from the Columbia River through the heart of the Crab Creek Wildlife Area. Rambles through the open desert can be fun (see the Lower Crab Creek Wildlife Area hike and connect into it if you like), but following the old railway provides a flat, easy trail trek.",
      "The drive up glorious Moses Coulee alone is worth the trip to this area, even if you never leave your vehicle. If you do decide to stretch your legs, the payoff is all the more fantastic: desert prairies, steep canyons, crashing waterfalls, fields of flowers, aerial antics of birds large and small, and more pure natural splendor than you'd expect from a desert canyon.",
      "This area is part of eastern Washington's channeled scabland, created by glacial floodwaters of the Pleistocene epoch. It is mostly rolling countryside with basalt outcroppings forming cliffs, mesas, box canyons, and potholes.",
      "From this small wildlife area, you'll enjoy views of Sentinel Gap. Along the route, you may also see bald eagles hunting over the sloughs south of the trailhead near the boat launch and red-tailed and Cooper's hawks hunting over the desert prairies.",
      "On summer weekends, rock climbers flock to the nearby Frenchman Coulee climbing area, drawn to the tall vertical columns of basalt that line the coulee walls. Hikers, who prefer their lands more horizontal than vertical, will also find great enjoyment here.",
      "The BLM only recently added this land parcel to the original Fishtrap Lake public land tract on the north side of the lake. To protect adjacent private land interests, fences have been placed along the south and west sides of this parcel to prevent you from wandering off the public lands. As you wander through the desert, you'll stumble across a small pond, which hosts an array of ducks and other water-fowl.",
      "The Desert Wildlife Area encompasses 35,100 acres. This was a true desert prior to the coming of the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project. Black sands (ground-up basalt) formed sand dunes, which were very actively moving until recent times.",
      "This trail climbs a narrow side valley above the Skykomish River, offering pretty views, sparkling waterfalls, and deep forest environments to explore and experience. The trail is popular with snowshoers, but don't expect to encounter many skiers here. The trail is far too narrow and the forest is way too close for most skiers' comfort.",
      "A tiny lake tucked in a hidden bowl on Hurricane Ridge, PJ Lake enter-tains few hikers due to its rough-and-tumble approach. On a trail pockmarked with deer tracks, drop steeply for 600 feet before climbing 350 feet to reach this emerald pool-all in less than a mile! Is it worth it? If you cherish solitude and the opportunity to spot wildlife up close, yes. Wildflowers and a pretty cascade offer a little incentive too.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The meadows surrounding the old historic cabin in the Hunting Ground are wonderfully diverse in both flora and fauna. The meadows also provide glorious views of Mount Rainier and the lesser summits of Copper Mountain, Pyramid Peak, and Iron Mountain. Note: Check with the ranger before heading out to make sure the footbridge across Kautz Creek is intact, especially if you are doing an early-season hike.",
      "Steep but very rewarding hike through forest to vast meadows with flowers and fat ripe berries, to a former lookout site with stunning views of Mount Rainier, the Goat Rocks crest and Mount Adams",
      "A little used but enjoyable hike in light forest. The trail is nicely graded and in good condition, with a few easy-to-bypass blowdowns. Progressively better views above 4000 ft , north toward Thorp Mtn and the Snoqualmie Peaks, especially from West Sasse Peak. Ends at the Sasse Ridge trail with access to the extensive Teanaway system of trails.",
      "The short route to Crater Lake was originally constructed by miners and fishermen, and is NOT a well-maintained trail. However, the tread is well defined and generally easy to follow.",
      "Hike around a tranquil little lake nestled in the hills just south of bustling Port Townsend. Amble through peaceful groves of fir and cedar. Savor the sweet smell of blossoming rhododendrons in the spring. Watch nervous ducks swim across placid waters while songbirds nesting in shoreline reeds hum sweet melodies. Gibbs Lake is a sanctuary for man and beast. But it almost didn't turn out this way. Thanks to negotiations by the Jefferson Land Trust, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources ceased logging here and converted the 669-acre haven into a county park."

      "Just when you thought you were stuck in the middle of endless cultivated farmland, you find this nugget of wild perfection! This wonderful refuge in a farm-rich region offers great habitat to wildlife and wonderful hiking to hikers.",
      "This lake is a popular summer destination for family campers, and it is even more impressive when visited in winter. The large lake is just outside the border of the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area, and an old service road slices through the forest alongside a water pipeline all the way to the dam at the lower end of the lake. The hike from the road end to the lake weaves through thick, old forest, and views are limited. But the local scenery makes up for the lack of distant sights.",
      "Starting with a road walk, this snowshoe trek leads through steep clearcuts, virgin forest, and up to some near-vertical alpine meadows, but throughout it all, one aspect is constant: incredible, staggering views.",
      "Mallardy Ridge is one of the spectacular wild areas that is seldom enjoyed by summer hikers because there are few true trails and no protection from motorized recreationists. Come winter, the old logging roads become de facto trails as the snow drifts over and around them, turning this heavily roaded area into a wild, scenic wonderland.",
      "Here's a route that lets snowshoers push themselves to the limit of their endurance, or if they'd rather, lets them enjoy a wonderful wilderness trek without much effort. Either way, enjoy wonderful scenery, stunning views, and a quiet solitude seldom experienced in the popular Alpine Lakes Wilderness.",

      "Snowshoes, though, make easy work of this trail, climbing gently as it does through deep, dry-side forests to end at the site of a pretty little waterfall. This cascade is rather unspectacular in summer months, but cloaked in snow and ice, the falls becomes a wonderful work of water art.",
      "A flat and easy hike through a rich Columbia River bottomland: explore snaking sloughs and observe a slew of bird and wildlife, including the federally endangered Columbian white-tailed deer.",
      "The roar of the highway is unmistakable when starting up this track, but soon the beauty of the winter wilderness surrounding the trail makes everything else fade into the background.",
      "The Wonderland Trail wraps around Mount Rainier, delving into every ecological zone on the mountain. This section carries you through several of those zones, including low-elevation old-growth forests, rich riparian zones, and higher-altitude fir and hemlock forests. You'll also explore an old forest fire site and check out one of the park's established backcountry camps. It's a wonderful route for early-summer exploration. Note: Check with the ranger before heading out to make sure the footbridge across Kautz Creek is intact, especially if you are doing an early-season hike.",

      "You'll be wagging your tongue over both the workout and the views after you enjoy this route. The workout comes by way of the last 0.75 mile to the summit, but you'll definitely earn the payoff you'll find at the top: stunning views of the Cispus River Valley and the peaks of the Dark Divide Roadless Area.",
      "The trail pierces sun-dappled old-growth pine forests and climbs alongside a sparkling mountain stream. This route is virtually ignored when blanketed in snow, so snowshoers are almost assured of solitude in this winter paradise."

      "The Coal Creek valley is the first large valley leading north away from the Mountain Loop Highway, and it offers outstanding opportunities to trek through untouched meadows, open stands of forest, and along clear, sparkling creeks. There is no true trail much of the way, but the wide valley allows snowshoers to pick out their own paths while enjoying the quiet basin and its surrounding natural beauty.",
      "Snowshoe through some of the oldest, most beautiful ancient forest left in Washington's Cascades while enjoying views of the rolling, crashing waters of the milky Nisqually River.",
      "Overcrowded in summer months, this trail is too often overlooked in the winter. The trail ascends through open fir and hemlock forests, dips low and rolls alongside a pretty mountain stream a time or two, and finally deposits dedicated snowshoers on the shores of a wide, pretty alpine lake nestled below a steep, avalanche-ravaged ridge.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Trek for miles up the long, gently sloping valley under the towering wall of Rampart Ridge before the route turns steep and you slog upward to increasingly picturesque views to reach a deep, steep lake cirque.",
      "This trail is largely ignored by skiers and snowmobilers despite its glorious wilderness-like atmosphere and stunning scenery. The trail branches off the Schweitzer Creek Road, which does draw a lot of snow traffic, and climbs gradually to a pretty little alpine lake amid young forest.",
      "Head up this trail anytime in September and listen closely. If the weather has started to turn cold, with autumn obviously in the air, you might hear the most haunting sound of the American wilderness: bugling elk. Autumn isn't the only time to visit, of course. Though you may not hear the elk in the summer, you might very well see them in the forest and meadows along Bumping River. This hike is a less-intense outing than some of the higher alpine trails, following an easy grade along the river drainage and gradually gaining elevation into the valley's upper reaches south of Crag Mountain.",
      "Is there anything more serene than snow-flocked pine trees? This route ambles gently up the wide Tieton River valley, rolling through broad meadows and through sun-streaked forests. Elk can often be found browsing amongst the trees, and even if the majestic big beasts are absent, you'll likely encounter lesser critters",
      "The best way to enjoy this scenic wonderland is by planning to spend the night beside the high mountain lake. By taking at least 2 days to complete the trek, the views and scenery can be enjoyed to their utmost.",
      "Although the snow is frequently thin at the base of this trail, the route climbs quickly and snowshoes are needed not only for flotation but also for traction on the steep slopes. The workout is extensive, but the rewards are phenomenal. The trail follows a beautiful tumbling creek as it rushes down a narrow gorge. Along the way, the creek drops over no fewer than four pretty waterfalls, with each successive one sporting larger and more intricate ice mantles.",
      "Starting with an easy stroll along a wide trail in a narrow creek valley, this trek offers a taste of all the best winter has to offer.",
      "Stunning views of Elk Mountain, Maiden Peak, Blue Mountain, and the deep Cox Creek valley lie off to the southeast.",
      "This is a lonely area of the Walla Walla River Delta, where the Walla Walla River empties into the Columbia River. The waters here are flat and slow moving, creating great habitat for a number of birds and animals, both in and out of the water.",
      "With its many open views back toward Pugh Mountain, this trail offers an exceptional weekend outing in the winter wilderness. Along the way, the views and local scenery are magnificent: from sweeping panoramas that take in Pugh and White Chuck Mountains to up-close and personal encounters with the deep gray-green forest of old fir, hemlock, and cedar wrapped in a cloak of snow and frost.",
      "This is a trek that can be tailored to any snowshoer: from an easy, flat walk perfect for families and first-time ‘shoers, to a strenuous climb along a well-graded road for more adventurous sorts, or to a full-on snowshoe scramble to the top of a gnarly peak for snowshoe mountaineers.",
      "Views from the entire top of Saddle Mountain are expansive. The urban sprawl of the Tri-Cities can be seen to the south, while the long, pristine stretch of the Hanford Reach portion of the Columbia Basin lies before you. To the north and directly below you, you'll see the dramatic coulee of Lower Crab Creek, and beyond that the flat farmlands of the Columbia Basin that extend to Othello and Moses Lake.",
      "This narrow wilderness trail follows the Chiwaukum Creek upstream to a junction with several other trails, providing opportunities for unbounded rambling in the winter wonderlands of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.",
      "Enjoy a great dip in the otherwise flat landscape where yet another upper portion of Crab Creek flows through. You can hike in both directions from the parking area trailhead to get the most out of your visit. Crab Creek is lined with lush growth in places, making it difficult to get down along the water's edge safely in late spring when the foliage is fully leafed out. This is great wildlife habitat but hiking through is difficult.",
      "The trail is quiet and often overlooked by snow­shoers--it is often overlooked by summer hikers as well--but it offers an excellent opportunity to get out and enjoy the wonders of a winter woodland environment; not to mention a chance to interact with an array of wildlife.",
      "The Lookout Mountain route combines a modest warm-up hike up a narrow access road with a long cross-country climb along the open steppes of a windswept flank of Lookout Mountain. The route provides plenty of local scenery to admire and enjoy, but the real thrill is found on the upper slopes, where sweeping views encompass the majority of the Okanogan National Forest.",
      "Come spring, this area explodes in color. Wildlife dots the landscape, but the bright and gaudy plumage of migrating birds (waterfowl and land dwellers) colors the sky, the bushes, and the water.",
      "This hike is best enjoyed early in the day. Late in the year (or early in the new year), start hiking shortly after sunrise to enjoy the cold beauty of the winter morning--the golden sunshine on the rocks, trees, and desert plants creates glorious patterns and colors along this desert trek.",
      "This is a great getaway since the trailhead is just a couple minutes off I-90 and offers access to tremendous roaming options in the northernmost reaches of the Potholes Wildlife Area. In this northern section of the wildlife area, the Potholes Reservoir is mostly just small lagoonlike curves of shallow water surrounded by rich habitat for wildlife (thanks to the huge stands of trees around the waterways).",

      "This short hike will take you on the Department of Natural Resources land, where you can see wonderful views of the entire Wenatchee Valley from the top. DO NOT do this hike in bad weather or wintery days.",
      "If you're up for it, the steep hike up Rooster Mountain will have you crowing--in agony after the thigh-burning 4000-foot gain, and with pleasure over the outstanding views. The Rooster Mountain Trail takes advantage of old logging roads for much of the route, but then follows an old boot-built path up a side canyon above Quartz Creek. Not for the faint of heart, but this route does boast outstanding rewards for those willing to put in the (considerable) effort.",
      "A sign-in permit is required due to the fact that the trail passes through the highly active U.S. Army's Yakima Training Center. You must not leave the trail. The John Wayne Trail (which rolls through the heart of the linear Iron Horse Trail State Park) follows the historic route of the Milwaukee Railroad from North Bend to the Columbia River (the trail will eventually be a true cross-state trail, but the stretch from the Columbia River to Idaho is still to be developed). This far eastern section of the completed trail explores some incredibly wild, pristine land--the designation of the surrounding lands as an Army training base actually helped preserve the area's wild beauty.",
      "Hike through a rare coastal old-growth Sitka spruce forest. Enjoy sweeping views of the mouth of the Columbia River. After your grunt up Scarborough Hill, snoop around the meticulously preserved early twentieth-century historic structures of this former military reservation.",
      "The Okanogan National Forest seems to have more fire watchtowers still standing than any other national forest in the state. The Buck Mountain Lookout is one of them, and like many of the other towers in the Methow Valley region, Buck Mountain's lookout makes an excellent destination for winter recreationists.",
      "Marmes Pond is a man-made pool on the edge of the Palouse River. The \"pond\" was actually meant to be a dry hole, but things didn't work out as planned. The pond was formed when an archeologist from Washington State University found an old rock shelter and human bones at a dig site along the shores of the lower Palouse River--the bones, dubbed the \"Marmes Man,\" were dated to more than 10,000 years old--much older than any other remains found in the region.",
      "Thorp Mountain is one of the preeminent summer hiking trails in the area, but winter recreationists often overlook the beautiful peak because it requires a long snowshoe slog along a road before jumping on the narrow trail to the summit.",
      "The two forests in question are separated in age by 2000 years, but they stand side by side. One forest is a lush, old-growth that surrounds this boardwalk trail. The other is a young forest that was originally engulfed and consumed by the lava flows from an eruption of Mount St. Helens more than two millennia ago. These three-dimensional imprints of trees are called lava casts-three-dimensional impressions in the rock-and this scenic loop trip offers plenty of opportunity to study them.",
      "High, rocky cliffs cradle snow-filled meadows and picturesque little groves of juvenile fir and hemlock. The climb to the pass is pretty enough to make the journey enjoyable, if not overly remarkable, but it's the destination that makes this snowshoe hike one to remember.",
      "Many individual mountains in Washington are extremely beautiful, but no range of peaks is more spectacular than the long, jagged line of the Stuart Range.",
      "Snowshoers flock to this trail on winter weekends, but there is something unusual about a lot of the snowshoers here. Many of them have long planks strapped to their backs as they ascend the steep trail. These are cross-over ‘shoers.",
      "This route provides the unique opportunity to snowshoe up the middle of one of the most popular highways in the state. Come summer, State Route 20 (North Cascades Highway) is swarming with tourist traffic. But by December the road is snowbound, and it stays that way until June or July most years.",
      "Imagine a view that encompasses the three great volcanoes of southern Washington, with Oregon's Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson tossed in for good measure, and the jagged line of the Goat Rocks peaks capping off the panoramic splendor. That's exactly what's found at the end of this scenic, if somewhat strenuous, trek up the flank of the Tatoosh Range to a wide saddle between Pinnacle Peak and The Castle.",
      "Views of the entire eastern half of the Snoqualmie Pass area, including the sprawling blue waters of Keechelus Lake and the snow-covered summits of Mount Catherine and Tinkham Peak to the south, can be had from the upper reaches of this route.",
      "With the sweeping line of white mountains that ends at glacier-capped Mount Olympus stretching before them, snowshoers will wonder why they ever bothered visiting this area in the summer.",
      "This is an excellent route for snowshoers looking for a quiet forest outing, without the need to struggle with a lot of climbing and routefinding. The trail is generally flat and wide, and it is low enough so that the snow doesn't obscure the trail.",
      "Plenty of beautiful local scenery surrounds this trail, though, including a sparkling forest stream and lush old-growth forests that have stood here for eons. Quiet solitude is also a feature of this often-overlooked winter trail.",
      "One of the most heavily visited trails in summer, the Eightmile Trail is virtually ignored by winter recreationists. In addition to peaceful solitude, this trail offers unmatched wilderness beauty. High alpine lakes appear in table-flat meadows covered by blankets of billowing white fluff.",
      "Bring the whole family to this beautiful river valley. The wide track, with plenty of open meadows and forest glades for exploring, offers great snow¬shoeing for folks of all abilities. The scenery will, likewise, appeal to all.",
      "The trail leads from a crowded ski area to a tiny wilderness lake amid a snow-blanketed forest. Snowshoers can amuse themselves watching the out-of-control antics of downhill skiers and snowboarders on the first mile of the hike and then put those crowds behind them and enjoy a quiet day amid wildlife of a different sort--whiskey jacks, snowshoe hares, snowy white ptarmigans (large, ground-roosting birds), martens, and even an occasional fox may be seen darting through the drifts.",
      "Skirting beautiful high alpine meadows, the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) rolls north from White Pass on a gentle climb, providing snowshoers with a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the high country of the Cascades in winter without a long slog up a wide logging road.",
      "This could be one of the best early-season snowshoe routes in the state. Ideally, visit this area when the snow is thin enough down low so that the road is passable to cars but the trail itself has enough snow to make snowshoes worthwhile. Mid- to late November is usually the time to find these conditions.",
      "Nothing beats an easy snowshoe stroll through the world-renowned winter wonderland of the Methow Valley. Rolling meadows of snow, nestled amid the tall, willowy aspen trees, sturdy pines, and towering firs, offer a wonderful playground for snow¬shoers, and the River Run Trail system is the way to experience these wonders.",
      "This route offers a glorious exploration in natural history as well as a bit of human history. The natural history comes in the form of deep, old forest and an abundance of wildlife.",
      "Often overlooked, this trail is overflowing with opportunities for snowshoers looking for solitude along a quiet forest path. The huge, old trees, abundant wildlife, and remarkable sylvan environment of this area, coupled with a general dearth of winter visitors, means this trail is an ideal retreat from the busy schedules of modern life.",
      "Looping through a cathedral forest of massive western red cedars and Douglas-fir, this trail offers a lesson in forest ecology. There are countless examples of life springing from death. Huge logs lie across the valley floor-the remains of ancient trees that finally died of age. Vibrant, young trees now grow from these great logs, nourished by the decaying wood of the old giants. Lush mosses, lichens, and ferns carpet the forest and give the trail an emerald glow. From the second half of the trail, you can enjoy views of the Muddy River.",
      "Here's one for the kids. The trail is short, but it offers a great lesson in the volcanic history of the region. It explores the shore of Takhlakh Lake and climbs into a small band of basalt lava that flowed from Mount Adams thousands of years ago.",
      "In 1995, the Richard King Mellon Foundation donated approximately 5661 acres to the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Spokane District, and that formed the core of the Duffy Creek Allotment, which totals 6580 acres of public land.",
      "What the trail namers call weeds, most of us call wildflowers. The meadows visited by this trail are home to some of the finest wildflower displays in the country, and the views beyond aren't too bad either. Look up from the brilliant blooms, and you'll see Mount Adams on one side, Mount Rainier on another. The jagged crest of the Goat Rocks peaks stretches to the north, and the deep blue waters of Walupt Lake lie below your feet, straight down the steep ridge wall."

      "A snowshoe up Hwy 410 towards Chinook Pass from the gate at Morse Creek.",
      "This trail represents the epitome of snowshoeing in the Cascades: a long, steady, often-steep climb through lush old forests ending at a high ridge with panoramic views of unmatched beauty.",
      "Hike to the lonely high divide between two of the Olympic Mountains' tallest sentinels, Mounts Constance and Mystery. Watch the entire deep emerald Dosewallips Valley unravel before you. And mountains! Towering crags of snow and ice: The Brothers, Anderson, Elk Lick, Diamond, and LaCrosse pack the southern horizon. At your feet, daz-zling displays of wildflowers grace sun-kissed slopes. It's a stiff climb to Sunnybrook Meadows, but the expansive views and sprawling meadows are sure to brighten your day.",
      "If you like water, this loop route should appeal to you. The William O. Douglas Wilderness boasts scores of lakes and hundreds of small ponds and tarns, and this loop takes advantage of many of those. You'll find all the great scenery that accompanies lakes, from rich foliage to great numbers of birds and small mammals. There are also a few big critters wandering the area, too, from massive mule deer to proud majestic wapati (aka Rocky Mountain elk).",
      "The McNary National Wildlife Refuge is primarily a waterfowl preserve. The refuge encompasses many flooded fields, sloughs, and inlets along the Columbia River. It also sprawls across farmlands that provide winter forage for migratory birds.",
      "This more upland route along Falls Creek rides the ridge above the creek, so you don't get falls or a creek; but you do get a splendid forest experience.",
      "Wander through a grove of big, beautiful ancient cedars on a hidden flat along the Little Wenatchee River. Then head over to a bubbling, gurgling soda spring. Children may be disappointed that they can't have a taste of the fizzy water, but deer and other furry critters drink liberally from the mineral-laden spring.",
      "Skyscrapers. Noisy, raucous crowds. Air traffic heavy enough to have you ducking your head at times. About what you'd expect in Seattle, and exactly what you get in Seattle Park--and that's a good thing.",
      "This route offers a perfect chance to see and experience a \"silver forest\" and to provide kids a learning experience as well. These stands of bright white trees can be found throughout the Pacific Northwest, thanks to the ever-present threat of wildfire. The silver forests are the standing skeletons of trees that were lashed by fast-moving, intensely hot forest fires. You'd never think a dead forest could look so beautiful and vibrant. But that's just what you'll find here.",
      "A pair of waterfalls is visible from this broad, compact-gravel trail. Climbing through a thick stand of Douglas-fir and noble fir, the route breaks into the open at a viewpoint overlooking Curly Creek Falls, a pretty cascade on the Lewis River. Enjoy the crashing water before moving up the trail to a second viewing platform. At this point the scenery consists of Miller Creek Falls, a smaller cascade that is as picturesque as Curly Creek Falls.",
      "The highest and loveliest of the Scottish Lakes, Lake Donald is reached via a way trail 1/2 mile and 500' above Loch Eileen.",
      "This is a steep trail that allows a scramble up Lundin Peak.",
      "This trail offers a bounty of purple gold: an endless tangle of huckleberry bushes. During every visit in late summer, I slow my hiking so I can pick as many ripe berries as possible while still making some trail mileage. Of course, berries aren't always ripe, so it's a good thing this trail offers far more than ripe fruit. It provides stunning views of the peaks of the South Cascades, including the near-perfect cone of Mount Adams, and ample opportunity to witness wildlife.",
      "This trail provides access for kayakers to the Sultan River at the gorge below the dam.",
      "A great hike with unsurpassed views into the Enchantments, but a road to the trailhead and a few steep sections.",
      "Grand Ridge is appropriately named. The views are grand, the wildflowers are grand, and trekking across its wide open slopes is a grand experience. But it gets grander. Reaching an altitude of 6600 feet, this trail is among the highest in the Olympics and one of the most scenic, with nonstop views of jagged glacier-covered peaks, deep valleys of unbroken old growth, and miles upon miles of wildflower-saturated meadows and tundra.",
      "Here's a trail to literally get your feet wet hiking. Drop into a cool box canyon-one of many on the south flank of the Olympics-then splash your way to the bottom of a spectacular waterfall. Fun on a hot day in late summer when the creek flow is low and passage is safe, this should never be attempted during periods of heavy rain. When the creek is roaring the falls can safely be seen from a viewing area above.",
      "A long, albeit decent logging road to a short, albeit pleasant trail, the trip to Evans Lake makes for a quick wilderness fix. Come here to snow probe in early season, berry pick in late summer, or reflect in late fall. Except perhaps for a few anglers, it should just be you and the frogs and the dragonflies at this little lake.",
      "More a triangle than a loop, this route offers breathtaking views from the summit of Nannie Peak-just as you might expect from the site of a former fire lookout tower. There's more than views to this hike, though. You'll find wonderful wildflower meadows along the crest of Nannie Ridge, a clear, cold swimming experience in Sheep Lake, a walk along the spine of the Cascades on the Pacific Crest Trail, and a cool forest hike in the Walupt Creek valley. The trail is short and gentle enough to enjoy as a long day hike, but the fine (though few) campsites at Sheep Lake, with their astounding views of Mount Adams (especially at sunset, when the alpenglow has the snowy peak of Adams aflame with orange light), can be too tempting to pass up, as many backpackers can attest.",
      "The channeled scablands region west of the lakes fills the scenic views here, creating a wonderful mosaic, especially in the twilight hours. The low angle of light casts the textured landscape into stark relief, creating complex patterns of shade and light. This glorious scenic landscape is made richer yet thanks to the plethora of wildlife thriving in the area.",
      "This area was trammeled after the construction of the Ice Harbor Dam, but since 1997 the heart of this remote wildlife area has been restored to native health. The Corps of Engineers has hosted revegetation plantings to restore the native steppe plants to improve the wildlife habitat (and therefore wildlife populations). The route through the area takes advantage of the restoration efforts, exploring the rich foliage and wildlife habitat of the area along the pretty stretch of the Snake River--a section of Lake Sacajawea, the impoundment behind the Ice Harbor Dam. The first 2 miles of hiking along the road (closed to vehicles) lead directly to the top of the bluff overlooking the area. Wonderful views!",
      "There is a trail of sorts to Lake Philippa - a big & beautiful alpine lake in the North Fork Snoqualmie River area - but it is not for the inexperienced.",
      "The Yellow Jacket-Hat Rock Trail allows you to enjoy the beauty of the southern end of Langille Ridge and the views from Hat Rock. You'll find a small tarn awaiting you at Yellow Jacket Pass, a broad, flat forest glade between Straight Creek and French Creek.",
      "Barrier-free trails are generally designed for folks with mobility concerns-people in wheelchairs or with walking limitations. This unique forest path serves those forest visitors admirably, but it does far more than that. It also opens a wonderful Northwest forest up to the visually impaired. Even hikers who are completely blind can enjoy this remarkable trail.",
      "Twin Sisters are two pillars of basalt that jut from the cliffs along Wallula Gap overlooking the Columbia River. Geologists say the rock formation is the result of erosion from a great flood near the end of the last Ice Age, about 12,000 to 15,000 years ago.",
      "Deep pine forests dominate this route, offering an experience in dry-side ecosystems (see \"Weather\" in the introduction). The trail weaves around massive orange-tinged ponderosa pines and through fragrant spruce groves. Beavers and otters swim in the river below the trail, and owls, hawks, and eagles soar in the air overhead. Huge elk, mule deer, and black bear wander the hillsides around the trail, and snakes, coyotes, and cougars prowl the brush between the trees.",
      "The Chinook Trail is a vision and work in progress. Once completed it will be a 300+ mile rim-to-rim loop encircling the Columbia River Gorge across both southern Washington and Oregon. To date the Chinook Trail Association (CTA) has completed a 30 mile stretch northeast of Vancouver that received National Recreation Trail status in 2005.",
      "To get to the site of the old Purcell Lookout, you have a choice: hike all the way from U.S. Highway 12, or let your car do part of the work. The Purcell Mountain Trail, which begins just west of the left-hand turn to Forest Road 63, leads 7.6 pleasant miles up the mountain to grand views at the lookout. The better option, though, is to take the Purcell Lookout Trail for a shorter, but still rugged, day hike.",
      "Okay, you're hiking through the heart of the ski area: so what? Once you pass the first ski lift you'll forget that you're in a de-veloped basin. The trail rolls up through forest, across alpine meadows, and past a couple of fine little lakes before erupting onto a high, wind-swept ridge that is rich with views.",
      "Spectacular sandstone spires and scenic views that extend all the way out to the sprawling Columbia Plateau are just a couple of the delights that Mount Lillian graciously offers. Brilliant wildflowers erupt in spring, and larches turn golden in fall, but do avoid this hike in the heart of summer when the sun is relentless. And avoid this area on weekends too, when it's opened to wheels, opting for quieter and much more enjoyable ambling on weekdays instead."

      "Pigs can't fly, but can they whistle? These pigs can, because they're actually marmots, named whistling pigs by early prospectors, loggers, and trappers. And in the Whistling Pig Meadow you'll probably stumble upon one, as well as an old cabin, acres of showy blossoms, reflecting pools, and classic Mad River high-country beauty",
      "Sasse Ridge offers views nearly as good as those found from Jolly Mountain without the muscle-ripping climb. You'll work hard for just over a mile, but then you have several miles of ridgetop meandering through meadows and over view-rich peaks. Few hikers visit this trail, so you can stride out and enjoy a quiet hike, stopping as often and for as long as you want to enjoy the fields of wildflowers on the dry (bring water), wind-swept ridge.",
      "Few people visit this trail, so you should have the deep-forest path to yourself. The route descends gradually from the road-end trailhead, dropping into the French Creek valley and eventually ending at a junction with Quartz Creek Trail alongside that stunningly pretty river.",
      "Following the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) south from the broad fields of Government Meadow, this route explores one of the most solitary sections of the nation's premiere trail. Hikers can experience deep forests and rock bluffs, and dogs can walk with their humans without worrying about encountering too many other hikers along the way. The trail starts on an old wagon road that crossed the Cascades at nearby Naches Pass (now used extensively by four-wheel-drive fanatics).",
      "The Siouxon area lacks the attention and the grandeur of the Dark Divide, but has its own graceful charm, and Horseshoe Ridge represents the best this region has to offer. The ridge is a long forested finger, covered with open meadows and wildflower fields.",
      "Old-growth forest, a deep, green lake stocked with big, toothy brook trout, and a lush aquatic environment are the highlights of this trail. The short but steep path penetrates a cool, lush, ancient forest before bursting out of the trees on the lakeshore.",
      "This trail loops around the east side of a large volcanic crater, on the edge of one of its last massive lava flows.",
      "This is a nice woods trail, but only few views reward the hiker until she/he arrives at Stevens Canyon road in Mt. Rainier N. P. Trail starts alongside a grassy rock slab and works its way to the top of the ridge.",
      "Along this trail, interpretive signs offer information on the flora, fauna, and geography of the area, but you won't need signs to figure out that this land is beautiful and wild. The wide, compacted trail meanders through ancient Douglas-fir forest before reaching the viewing platform overlooking the falls.",
      "Pine and fir forest fill the valley of Union Creek, providing a cool retreat from the heat of summer. Explore open meadows and shadow-laden forests, watching for the deer and elk that browse through the valley and the birds that swarm the clusters of berry bushes and bug-rich creekbed. Hammer-headed woodpeckers and flickers pound out a bass line behind the melody of twittering nuthatches and trilling juncos. Not everyone will hear these feathered musicians--they have to take a break between sets--but everyone can enjoy the fragrant pine forest and, from the end of the trail, the spectacular views over the valley and beyond.",
      "Following the Wonderland Trail, this route explores the floor of Stevens Canyon, and along the way, you'll find a number of waterfalls along Stevens Creek and its tributaries. The trail is broad and generally well maintained, though the 2006 storms took out some of the bridges and washed out one section of trail.",
      "A great hike for shade and well-maintained trails with views of waterfalls and rock-faces. It is an ideal hike for starting out with a family.",
      "The local wildlife love the Owyhigh Lakes. This pair of shallow forest lakes provides good water, lots of forage in the shoreline meadows, and wonderful cover in the forests that press in around the lakes.",
      "Leisurely hike to a quiet backcountry lake ringed with grassy meadows and big trees, or break a sweat to the Little Divide, the loneliest outpost in the Sol Duc country. Lacking the panoramic vistas that the High Divide is notorious for, Little Divide trades views for solitude. You're far more likely to encounter deer, elk, and bear than fellow hikers in this neck of the Sol Duc.",
      "A lengthy, pleasant hike through lodgepole pine and deciduous forest, past a lovely waterfall to Abernathy Pass.",
      "Webb Mountain is the peak directly to the West of Putrid Pete's Peak. It can be reached via the P3 trail and then by following the ridge line west.",
      "Hikers might feel like there's no end in sight on the long, steep climb that characterizes the Bishop Ridge Trail. But really, the trail does level off. You just need to put in the miles! The trail levels out somewhat on the ridge and then leapfrogs from one ridge-top meadow to another, passing through intermittent sections of dense fir forest. So really, whatever the effort required, it's worth it, if you enjoy exploring lush forest ecosystems.",
      "A moderately difficult hike to a large subalpine lake frequented by many of its namesake critters or an all-day challenging grunt to perhaps the most beautiful viewpoint in the Olympics. This is the famed High Divide country, a land of sparkling alpine lakes, resplendent alpine meadows, and awe-inspiring alpine views. Usually reserved for backpackers with time to explore, strong and tenacious day hikers can get a small taste.",
      "This is an easy walk up to a picturesque fire lookout. Along the way, you'll find huckleberries in abundance along the track, and views that get increasingly better as you climb the slight grade. You have the option of hiking the old dirt road, or following a short trail that loops around the other side of the peak on its way to the summit. Either way, the views are grand and the walking is easy and highly enjoyable.",
      "If you're looking for a workout, with some great views along the way, this is the route for you. But the workout is worth it, especially if you like wild country full of wildflowers and wildlife.",
      "There's something special about the Teanaway Country. Fragrant pine forests. Sprawling wildflower fields. Grand views. Wildlife of all kinds and sizes. Miller Peak has all this, and more.",
      "",
      "Laughingwater Creek is a beautiful stream tumbling through a moss-laden forest, and Three Lakes is a wonderful trio of tarns in a high alpine basin; they deserve a livelier name. This trail is a marvelous route to explore early--it's usually snow free by late June or early July. Visit while the waters are still running strong to hear the biggest chuckles.",
      "Can't get enough of the Icicle Gorge? But need to escape the hubbub of the Icicle Gorge River Trail? Venture on this path less chosen, then-the Icicle Gorge View Trail. Here you'll be able to enjoy the river's roar and soak up views of the glacier-created valley cradling it, all by your lonesome. But prepare for some brush, as this trail is yet another in the long line of our trails in danger of vanishing if it doesn't receive some much needed maintenance soon.",

And just when you think you're done climbing, you'll drop a few hundred feet and then climb some more. But the flowered meadows, and tundra slopes, and precariously perched larches, and the awesome views of nearby lofty peaks . . . make it all worth it!",
      "Few areas can match the panoramic splendor of the view that sweeps over the pretty desert canyon of with a broad field of wildflowers filling the foreground. This BLM land is one of the areas described within that agency's \"Watchable Wildflower\" booklet.",
      "Peak-baggers love the lookout-rich Cowlitz Valley. The number of high peaks that once housed fire watch stations in this deep, forested valley is astounding. This trail loops through some of those forests, past a brilliant, clear spring boasting nice campsites if you want to spend the night, and then on to the summit with its grand views of the upper Cowlitz Valley.",
      "",
      "This trail challenges hikers right from the start as it begins with a descent and ends with a climb. But for all the sweat you pump out, all the calories you burn, you'll earn great rewards. Fabulous wildflower fields, stunning scenery, glorious views await you, as you cross one old fire lookout site.",

      "Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, the Goat Rocks, and the Tatoosh Range are all visible from this 5800-foot peak. The views are stunning and well worth the short hike up. The trail is a bit rough, but the distance is short enough that you can enjoy a good stretch of the legs, bask in the grand views, and still only invest a few short hours out of your hectic schedule.",
      "Once upon a time, the Cascade Crest Trail rolled through the Rock Creek valley, carrying hikers down from the ridge above Snoqualmie Pass. That old scenic high route later became the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). While the PCT followed much of the old Cascade Crest route, this Rock Creek section was replaced when trail builders carved a new high route into the face of Kendall Peak. The Rock Creek Trail was forgotten for many years, but hiking legends Harvey Manning and Ira Spring refused to let a good trail die and they added the path to one of their last guidebooks.",
      "Don't let the name scare you: This is a fine trail with only a few bugs, at least compared to some of the other routes in the South Cascades. Most of the trail stays well clear of water bodies, so the skeeter population is relatively low. The first section of trail is far from spectacular, but there are unbeatable views once you climb into the beautiful high country on the second half of the route.",
      "Chenuis Creek stair-steps down a series of rocky platforms to form the multitiered Chenuis Falls. The short trail leading to the noisy cascade is perfect for families or for visiting relatives who want to experience the diverse beauty of Mount Rainier National Park without excessive effort."

      "Shadowed by sheer cliffs and decorated by sandstone spires, Devils Gulch is a deep valley rich in birdlife and diverse in vegetation. The heart of a 25,000-acre roadless area containing large tracts of primeval pines and exceptional wildlife habit, the devil is in the details. The trail is open to dirt bikes and revered by fat-tire aficionados. Steer clear on weekends and avoid this hike altogether in summer when Devils Gulch can get as hot as hell.",
